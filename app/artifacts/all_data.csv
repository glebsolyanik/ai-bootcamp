"Что такое специалитет? Специалитет в вузе — это одна из программ, которая готовит квалифицированных специалистов. Простыми словами — студент, выбравший этот вариант обучения, получает узкоспециальную профессию. Такую, как звукорежиссёр, клинический психолог, судмедэксперт и прочее. Срок обучения на специалитете — 5–6 лет. Первые два года студент проходит общую базовую подготовку по выбранному направлению. Следующие 3–4 года занимает расширенное изучение профессии. С дипломом специалиста можно поступить в аспирантуру. В 2025 году специалитет включает 106 специальностей, которые предусматривают около 300 зачётных единиц — практики, учебные дисциплины и итоговую аттестацию.",edu
"Какие Плюсы специалитета? Специалитет подразумевает более углублённый уровень обучения — зачётных единиц здесь почти на треть больше, чем в бакалавриате. Студенты изучают прикладные дисциплины, которые после вуза позволяют устраиваться на востребованную работу с солидной заработной платой. Например, моделирование высокотехнологичных систем или разработку промышленного оборудования.Если студент после окончания обучения хочет продолжить учёбу или заняться научно-исследовательской деятельностью, специалитет предоставляет ему выбор. В дальнейшем можно поступить в магистратуру или аспирантуру.",edu
"Какие Минусы специалитета? К минусам специалитета можно отнести более долгий срок обучения. Кроме того, возможность получить специальность есть не во всех вузах.",edu
"Что такое бакалавриат? До 2003 года выбора, как такового, у студентов не было — все учились пять лет и получали диплом специалиста. Когда Россия присоединилась к международной Болонской системе, студенты смогли получать высшее образование по ускоренной программе. Она включает в себя базовые знания по направлению обучения, которое обычно длится четыре года. Если студент стремится поднять уровень своих знаний, ему придётся ещё на два года поступить в магистратуру — главное, чтобы таковая была в выбранном вузе. Но можно продолжить обучение и в другом учебном заведении. У будущих бакалавров гораздо больший выбор в плане направлений — 187, зачётных единиц на треть меньше — около Главный плюс бакалавриата — возможность устроиться на работу и в России, и за рубежом. Иностранные работодатели охотно принимают не связанных с конкретной специальностью выпускников-бакалавров, поскольку Болонская система образования имеет широкое распространение в США и Европе. Найти работу по специальности за границей несколько сложнее — аналогов специалитета в той же Европе нет. Бакалавры могут поступить в магистратуру, в том числе на бюджет. При этом им предоставляют отсрочку от армии.",edu
"Какие минусы бакалавриата Степени бакалавра часто бывает недостаточно, если выпускник вуза собирается устроиться в бюджетную организацию или на госслужбу. В таких структурах выше ценится прикладная специальность. За границей устроиться на работу проще, однако придётся подтвердить уровень владения иностранным языком.",edu
"Отличия бакалавриата от специалитета Ключевые различия между бакалавриатом и специалитетом заключаются в продолжительности и содержании обучения. Бакалавры и специалисты получают диплом о высшем образовании. Однако на бакалавриате в документе будет указано звание «бакалавр». Тогда как на специалитете прописывают специальность, например «художник-декоратор».",edu
"Сроки поступления и вступительные испытания на бакалавриат и специалитет не отличаются — абитуриентов принимают после школы или колледжа. Равно как и дополнительные испытания вуз может предусмотреть по обеим программам. Стоимость обучения — примерно одинаковая. Однако у бакалавриата часто бывают скидки за счёт большей популярности среди абитуриентов. Скидки на специалитет — редкость. При этом можно рассчитывать на квоты по бюджетным местам — как правило, такое встречается среди врачебных специальностей.",edu
"Что изменится в системе высшего образования с сентября 2026 года? Летом 2022 года Россия вышла из Болонской системы, однако в 2025-м всё ещё вёдётся набор студентов на бакалавриат в большинстве ВУЗов. С началом нового учебного года осенью 2026 года бакалавриат и специалитет в России будут упразднены. Вместо них будет базовое высшее образование. Магистратуру заменит специализированное высшее образование, а профессиональное высшее — вместо аспирантуры. В шести крупных университетах уже вступила в силу новая система высшего образования.",edu
"Что будет с дипломами, полученным до введения базового высшего образования? Дипломы останутся полноценными и будут иметь прежнюю силу. Аналогичной была история с дипломами, которые были получены в СССР и в России до появления бакалавриата и специалитета.",edu
"Что будет с образованием студентов, поступивших в ВУЗы до введения базового высшего образования? По разъяснению Минобрнауки, учащиеся, поступившие на бакалавриат и специалитет, смогут завершить те учебные программы, на которые они поступали. Тем самым переход на новые рельсы будет плавным.",edu

"Что такое звезда Мишлен? Звезда Мишлен — одна из самых престижных наград в мире гастрономии, которая присуждается ресторанам. Этот знак отличия ассоциируется с безупречным качеством еды, высоким уровнем сервиса и профессионализма. Но звезда Мишлен — это не только награда для ресторана. Она также отражает высокий уровень профессионализма шеф-повара и его команды.",Michelin
"Как появилась звезда Мишлен? Французская компания Michelin, основанная в 1889 году братьями Андре и Эдуардом Мишлен, прославилась производством шин для автомобилей. Однако бизнес, связанный с производством шин, потребовал необычных маркетинговых решений для привлечения внимания к автотуризму, который тогда только зарождался. Чтобы стимулировать автомобилистов к путешествиям, в 1900 году компания начала выпускать красный гид Мишлен — справочник, который содержал полезную информацию для водителей, включая карты дорог, заправочные станции, гостиницы и рестораны. Спустя годы руководство Michelin заметило, что рестораны становятся все более важной частью путешествий. В 1926 году появилась первая звезда Мишлен, которая была введена для выделения ресторанов с отличной кухней. В 1931 году система была усовершенствована, и появился трехзвездочный рейтинг.",Michelin
"Сколько уровней звезд Мишлен существует? Существует три уровня: одна звезда — «очень хороший ресторан в своей категории», две звезды — «отличная кухня, ради которой стоит сделать крюк», три звезды — «исключительная кухня, ради которой стоит совершить отдельное путешествие».",Michelin
"Кто присуждает звезды Мишлен? Звезды присуждаются инспекторами Michelin Guide, которые инкогнито посещают рестораны и оценивают их по строгим критериям. Никто из сотрудников ресторана не знает о визите инспекторов, что обеспечивает объективность оценки.",Michelin
"Кто такие инспекторы Мишлен? Это профессионалы ресторанного бизнеса, работающие инкогнито. Их личности держатся в строжайшей тайне.",Michelin
"Какие критерии учитываются при присуждении звезд Мишлен? Основные критерии включают качество ингредиентов, уровень мастерства приготовления, гармонию вкусов, индивидуальность кухни и стабильность качества блюд.",Michelin
"Что дает звезда Мишлен? Получение звезды Мишлен кардинально меняет судьбу ресторана и шеф-повара. Награда привлекает новых клиентов, увеличивает узнаваемость заведения и может значительно повысить цены на блюда. Однако с этим приходит и огромная ответственность. Заведениям необходимо постоянно поддерживать высокий уровень качества, чтобы сохранить свою звезду. В противном случае ресторан может её потерять.",Michelin
"Можно ли потерять звезду Мишлен? Звезда Мишлен — это не пожизненная награда. Ресторан может лишиться ее, если не будет поддерживать высокий стандарт качества. Один из самых известных примеров — это японский суши-бар Sukiyabashi Jiro в Токио, который утратил звезду Мишлен, несмотря на мировую известность. Причина проста: заведение стало недоступным для широкой публики, и обычные посетители не могли туда попасть.",Michelin
"Обязательно ли ресторан должен быть дорогим, чтобы получить звезду Мишлен? Нет, стоимость блюд не является критерием. Даже скромные заведения могут получить звезду, если предлагают исключительную кухню.",Michelin
"Как часто проводятся проверки ресторанов для гида Мишлен? Инспекторы посещают рестораны несколько раз, чтобы убедиться, что уровень качества остается неизменно высоким. Сама система оценки остаётся тайной, а инспекторы обязаны хранить конфиденциальность.",Michelin
"Есть ли рестораны с четырьмя звездами Мишлен? Максимально возможное количество звезд — это три. Более высоких категорий в системе Мишлен не существует, и информация о «пятизвездочных ресторанах Мишлен» является мифом.",Michelin
"Какой ресторан первым получил три звезды Мишлен? Одним из первых ресторанов, получивших три звезды, стал «La Tour d’Argent» во Франции в 1933 году.",Michelin
"Влияет ли интерьер ресторана на присуждение звезды? Нет, но атмосфера и комфорт оцениваются в отдельной категории гида.",Michelin
"Может ли фастфуд-ресторан получить звезду Мишлен? Да, если он соответствует стандартам качества. Например, ресторан уличной еды в Сингапуре получил звезду Мишлен в 2016 году.",Michelin
"Какой город имеет наибольшее количество ресторанов с тремя звездами Мишлен? Токио — город с наибольшим количеством ресторанов, имеющих три звезды.",Michelin
"Есть ли звезды Мишлен в России? На 2025 год список ресторанов со звездами Мишлен в России насчитывает девять заведений. Из них семь обладают одной отметкой, два заведения – двумя.",Michelin
"Какой ресторан и когда в России получил первую звезду Michelin? Первый ресторан в России со звездой Мишлен – известное в столице место «Селфи», принадлежащий Анатолию Казакову получили награду в 2021 году.",Michelin
"Какие самые известные шеф-повара со звездами Мишлен? Ален Дюкасс: шеф-повар с 21 звездой Мишлен на разных этапах своей карьеры. Гордон Рамзи: известный британский шеф, чьи рестораны собрали 16 звезд Мишлен. Эти повара стали иконами мировой кулинарии, их рестораны входят в списки лучших заведений на планете.",Michelin
"Какие страны с наибольшим количеством звезд Мишлен? Франция: родина награды, здесь сосредоточено более 30 ресторанов с тремя звездами. Япония: страна высококлассной кухни, в которой находятся десятки ресторанов с высшими оценками. Италия, Испания, США: эти страны тоже могут похвастаться множеством заведений с двумя и тремя звездами Мишлен.",Michelin
"Что такое потребительская корзина? В 1992 году в России впервые составили перечень продуктов питания, промышленных товаров и услуг, необходимых человеку для удовлетворения базовых потребностей. Позже его назвали потребительской корзиной, а в 1999 году закрепили это понятие в законе. С тех пор ПК служит своеобразным ориентиром, к которым государство соотносит доходы населения, льготы и социальные выплаты. ПК помогает вести статистику в масштабах страны: сколько население должно потреблять и каковы реальные объёмы потребления.",potr_carz
"Как рассчитывается потребительская корзина? ПК формируют отдельно для детей, трудоспособного населения и пенсионеров. Росстат собирает и обрабатывает информацию о фактических основных расходах (на еду, коммуналку, лекарства и т. п.) в малоимущих семьях. Затем эту информацию соотносят с рекомендациями учёных по минимальным потребностям человека. А ещё наполнение корзины зависит от ситуации в экономике страны и возможностей бюджета.",potr_carz
"Как составляется список продуктов потребительской корзины? Составляя список продовольственных и непродовольственных товаров, учитывают следующие факторы -состав и энергетическую ценность продуктов питания; климатические условия разных территорий России;национальные традиции и местные особенности питания в регионах. Территория РФ поделена на десять зон, и в каждой из них своя потребительская корзина. К примеру, на севере страны выше потребление жиров, поскольку на холоде нужно больше энергоёмкой пищи. В приморских регионах едят больше рыбы, на юге — овощей и фруктов. В мусульманских регионах в мясной группе продуктов преобладает говядина и баранина, и почти нет свинины. Есть разница и в наполнении корзины непродовольственными товарами и услугами (покупка одежды и обуви, оплата коммунальных услуг и т.п.). В холодных климатических зонах их потребление на 15–20 % выше, чем в регионах с тёплым и умеренным климатом.",potr_carz
Чему равна стоимость потребительской корзины? С 1999 по 2021 год стоимость ПК была чуть меньше прожиточного минимума. Сейчас минимальная потребительская корзина официально не рассчитывается. И только по традиции её приравнивают к прожиточному минимуму. В 2025 году его размер составляет 17 733 рубля на человека (средний месячный показатель по стране на душу населения).,potr_carz
"Что входит в состав потребительской корзины? Потребительская корзина в РФ состоит из трёх компонентов.Первый - Продукты питания — 50 % от общей стоимости. второй - Непродовольственные товары —25 %. Третий - Услуги — 25 %. Продуктовая часть корзины — более тридцати наименований продуктов, объединённых в одиннадцать групп. Это хлебобулочные и мучные изделия, крупы, картофель, несколько основных видов овощей и фруктов, мясо, рыба, яйца, молочные продукты, сахар, растительные жиры и пр. Продукция посчитана в килограммах на год на одного человека. Пользуясь этими цифрами, можно посчитать, сколько чего нужно на месяц, рассчитать дневную норму потребления. Непродовольственная группа включает одежду, обувь, бельё, постельные принадлежности, хозтовары, лекарства и другие предметы первой необходимости. Они рассчитаны в штуках с учётом времени износа. В разделе услуг заложены расходы на оплату жилья, коммуналку (вода, электричество, газ, отопление), транспорт и пр. Каждые пять лет продуктовую корзину пересматривают. Это происходит не только потому, что растут цены. Меняется и её наполнение. По сравнению с 1999 годом в наборе жизненно необходимых товаров стало меньше растительных жиров и маргарина, хлеба, мучных изделий, картофеля, зато выросли нормы для молочных продуктов, фруктов и овощей, мяса, рыбы, яиц.",potr_carz

"How are you going to make money out of this? We believe in fast and secure messaging that is also 100% free. Our founder and CEO Pavel Durov, who financed Telegram throughout most of its history, has outlined a strategy to make Telegram sustainable in this post. Following this plan, Telegram has implemented sustainable forms of monetization that prioritize its users: In 2021, Telegram launched Sponsored Messages – minimalist, privacy-conscious advertisements that can appear in certain public channels. In 2022, Telegram launched a Premium subscription which users can purchase to both support the app and unlock additional exclusive features. These revenue streams help us pay for infrastructure costs and developer salaries, however making profits will never be an end-goal for Telegram.",telegram
"What are you thoughts on internet privacy? We think that the two most important components of Internet privacy should be: protecting your private conversations from snooping third parties, such as officials, employers, etc. and protecting your personal data from third parties, such as marketers, advertisers, etc. Telegram's aim is to create a truly free messenger, with a revolutionary privacy policy.",telegram
"There's illegal content on Telegram. How do I take it down? All Telegram apps have 'Report' buttons that let you flag illegal content for our moderators — in just a few taps. On Telegram for Android, tap the message and select Report from the menu. On iOS, press and hold the message. On Telegram Desktop, Web or Telegram for macOS, right-click the message and select Report. Then choose an appropriate reason.",telegram
"How do I send a request under EU Regulation 2021-784? The Regulation (EU) 2021-784 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2021 on addressing the dissemination of terrorist content online (Terrorist Content Online Regulation, or TCO Regulation) allows authorities in EU countries to send removal requests for terrorist content, if it is discovered on Telegram's public platform. We have also designated a third party, European Digital Services Representative (EDSR), to assist us with TCO-related communications. Users whose publications were taken down in connection with the TCO Regulation can request details on why their publications were considered terrorist and how to challenge the removal by contacting the EUregulation bot on Telegram.",telegram
"A bot or channel is infringing on my copyright. What do I do? Private groups and chats on Telegram are private amongst their participants. We do not process any requests related to them. However, Telegram also supports sticker sets, bots, channels and groups that are publicly available. If you see a bot, channel, sticker set, or other content that is a part of Telegram’s public platform and is infringing on your copyright, kindly submit a complaint to dmca@telegram.org. Please note that such requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.",telegram
"Do you process take-down requests from third parties? Our mission is to provide a secure means of communication that works everywhere on the planet. To do this in the places where it is most needed (and to continue distributing Telegram through the App Store and Google Play), we have to process legitimate requests to take down illegal public content (e.g., sticker sets, bots, groups and channels) within the app. For example, we can take down sticker sets that violate intellectual property rights or porn bots. Public content on Telegram, such as user-uploaded stickers sets, channels, and bots by third-party developers, is not part of the core Telegram UI. Whenever we receive a report regarding potentially illegal public content, we perform the necessary legal checks and take it down when deemed appropriate. Please note that this does not apply to local restrictions on freedom of speech. For example, if criticizing the government is illegal in some country, Telegram won't be a part of such politically motivated censorship. This goes against our founders' principles. While we do block terrorist (e.g. ISIS-related) bots and channels, we will not block anybody who peacefully expresses alternative opinions.",telegram
"My bot or sticker set was banned unfairly, what do I do? If you think we banned your bot, channel, or sticker set for no apparent reasons, drop us a line at abuse@telegram.org.",telegram
"Do you process data requests? Secret chats use end-to-end encryption, thanks to which we don't have any data to disclose. To protect the data that is not covered by end-to-end encryption, Telegram uses a distributed infrastructure. Cloud chat data is stored in multiple data centers around the globe that are controlled by different legal entities spread across different jurisdictions. The relevant decryption keys are split into parts and are never kept in the same place as the data they protect. As a result, several court orders from different jurisdictions are required to force us to give up any data. Thanks to this structure, we can ensure that no single government or block of like-minded countries can intrude on people's privacy and freedom of expression. Telegram can be forced to give up data only if an issue is grave and universal enough to pass the scrutiny of several different legal systems around the world. To this day, we have disclosed 0 bytes of user messages to third parties, including governments.",telegram
Who can I write to? You can write to people who are in your phone contacts and have Telegram. Another way of contacting people is to type their Telegram username into the search field – you don't need to know their phone number to do this.,telegram
"Who can contact me? People can contact you on Telegram if they know your phone number or if you message them first. If they don't know your phone number, they can find you if you both are members of the same group or if you set a public username. Others can use Global Search and find you by your public username.",telegram
"Does Telegram send Verification Codes for other apps? Telegram allows third-party services to send verification codes to their users via Telegram. These codes only appear in the verified Verification Codes chat, and let you tap to instantly copy the code.If you receive a code in the Verification Codes chat, it's probably because you requested to log in to a third-party service, like an external website, app or marketplace. It's also possible that someone else accidentally entered your phone number when logging in to another service. Either way, your Telegram account is completely safe — if you didn’t request a code, simply tap on it and select Report buttom, no need to do anything else. Third-party services determine which way your verification codes are sent – and Telegram is not able to control this or make a service aware of your preferences. Unlike SMS codes that frequently fail to arrive and can be interecepted, verification codes sent via Telegram are delivered instantly and are securely encrypted – making them safer and more reliable for both users and services. The Verification Codes chat is only used for codes from third-party services. Login codes for your Telegram account itself are sent to the verified service notifications chat named Telegram in your chat list and should never be shared with anyone, including other services or apps.",telegram
"How do I know who in my contacts has Telegram? Your contacts, who have Telegram, are shown at the top of your Contacts. They also have pictures.",telegram
"How do I invite my friends? iOS: The basic invitations are simple SMS messages. They will be charged as standard outgoing SMS by your carrier (unless sent via iMessage). Naturally, you have other options to bring your friends here. Try sending them a download link via any other messaging service: email, Facebook, WhatsApp, an actual telegram — you name it. Android: Open the app menu (swipe right in chat list) and then click Invite Friends. Then choose an application via which you would like to send out invitations.",telegram
What do the check marks mean? One check — message delivered to the Telegram cloud and your friend has been notified if he allows notifications. Two checks — message read (your friend opened Telegram and opened the conversation with the message). We don't have a delivered to device status for messages because Telegram can run on as many devices as you want. So which particular one would that check mean?,telegram
"Can I hide my last seen time? You can choose who sees this info in Privacy and Security settings. Remember that you won't see Last Seen timestamps for people with whom you don't share your own. You will, however, see an approximate last seen value. This keeps stalkers away but makes it possible to understand whether a person is reachable over Telegram.",telegram
"Can I delete my messages? Yes. You can always delete any messages you sent or received for both sides in any one-on-one conversation (in groups, it's still your own messages only). You can also clear the entire chat history on both ends. On Telegram, deleted messages do not leave a mark in the chat.Together with privacy settings for forwarded messages, this makes exchanging Telegram messages similar to talking face to face (without a tape recorder). As a result, users no longer need to worry about the data accumulating in their chats over the years. Both parties in a conversation have full control over what does and what doesn't belong to their online identity.",telegram
"Can I make calls via Telegram? Yes! You can make end-to-end encrypted Voice Calls and Video Calls. If you want more participants, try starting a Voice Chat in one of the groups you created. Voice Chats add a live layer of ephemeral talk to the group. They can be used as virtual office spaces for teams or informal lounges for any community. While Voice Chats are not group calls, they can achieve similar goals.",telegram
"How can I use emoticons? Type one word in your input field to get relevant emoji suggestions. You can also type “:” followed by any keyword to open emoji search – like :heart. You can suggest missing keywords for emoji in your language using this interface (this will open suggestions for English, don't forget to change to your language in the left menu).",telegram
"What's the difference between groups and channels? Telegram groups are ideal for sharing stuff with friends and family or collaboration in small teams. But groups can also grow very large and support communities of up to 200,000 members. You can make any group public, toggle persistent history to control whether or not new members have access to earlier messages and appoint administrators with granular privileges. You can also pin important messages to the top of the screen so that all members can see them, including those who have just joined. Channels are a tool for broadcasting messages to large audiences. In fact, a channel can have an unlimited number of subscribers. When you post in a channel, the message is signed with the channel's name and photo and not your own. Each message in a channel has a view counter that gets updated when the message is viewed, including its forwarded copies.",telegram
"How do I create a group? IOS: Start a new message and then click on ""New Group"". Android: Tap the circular pencil icon in the chat list and then click on ""New Group"". Telegram Desktop: click the menu button in the top left corner and then click on ""New Group"".",telegram
"What are usernames? How do I get one? You can set a public username on Telegram. It then becomes possible for other users to find you by that username – you will appear in search under global results. Please note that people who find you will be able to send you messages, even if they don't know your number. If you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting a username on Telegram. You can set up a username in Settings and use the universal search box in the chat list to search for chats, messages, and usernames.",telegram
"What are Collectible Usernames? How are they different from basic usernames? Collectible usernames work just like basic usernames, they appear in Global Search results and have their own links that can be used outside of Telegram: username.t.me. They can be bought and sold through third-party platforms like Fragment, giving a simple and secure way to acquire and exchange valuable Telegram domains. Acquiring a collectible username gives permanent ownership, verified by the TON blockchain. Owners of collectible usernames can freely assign them to chats, sell them to others, or keep them for later use.",telegram
"What can I use as my username? You can use a-z, 0-9 and underscores. Usernames are case-insensitive, but Telegram will store your capitalization preferences (e.g. Telegram and TeleGram is the same user).",telegram
"Do I need a username? You don't have to get one. Remember that Telegram usernames are public and choosing a username on Telegram makes it possible for people to find you in global search and send you messages even if they don't have your number. If you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting up a username.",telegram
"If someone finds me by username, messages and I reply — will they know my number? No. Neither party will see another's phone number (unless this is permitted by your privacy settings). This is similar to the case when you message a person who you've met in a Telegram group.",telegram
How do I delete my username? Go to Settings and save an empty username. This will remove your username; people will no longer be able to find you via search. This will not affect existing conversations.,telegram
"How secure is Telegram? Telegram is more secure than mass market messengers like WhatsApp and Line. We are based on the MTProto protocol, built upon time-tested algorithms to make security compatible with high-speed delivery and reliability on weak connections. We are continuously working with the community to improve the security of our protocol and clients.",telegram
"What if I’m more paranoid than your regular user? We've got you covered. Telegram’s special secret chats use end-to-end encryption, leave no trace on our servers, support self-destructing messages and don’t allow forwarding. On top of this, secret chats are not part of the Telegram cloud and can only be accessed on their devices of origin.",telegram
"So how do you encrypt data? We support two layers of secure encryption. Server-client encryption is used in Cloud Chats (private and group chats), Secret Chats use an additional layer of client-client encryption. All data, regardless of type, is encrypted in the same way be it text, media or files. Our encryption is based on 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. You can find more info in the Advanced FAQ.",telegram
"Why should I trust you? Telegram is open, anyone can check our source code, protocol and API, see how everything works and make an informed decision. Telegram supports verifiable builds, which allow experts to independently verify that our code published on GitHub is the exact same code that is used to build the apps you download from App Store or Google Play. We welcome security experts to audit our system and appreciate any feedback at security@telegram.org. On top of that, Telegram's primary focus is not to bring a profit, so commercial interests will never interfere with our mission.",telegram
"Do I need to trust Telegram for this to be secure? When it comes to secret chats, you don't — just make sure that the visualized key of your secret chat matches the one in your friend's secret chat settings.",telegram
"What if my hacker friend says they could decipher Telegram messages? Anyone who claims that Telegram messages can be deciphered is welcome to prove that claim in our competition and win $300,You can check out the Cracking Contest Description to learn more. Any comments on Telegram's security are welcome at security@telegram.org. All submissions which result in a change of code or configuration are eligible for bounties, ranging from $100 to $100,000 or more, depending on the severity of the issue. Please note that we can not offer bounties for issues that are disclosed to the public before they are fixed.",telegram
"Why can jailbroken and rooted devices be dangerous? Using a rooted or jailbroken device makes it easier for a potential attacker to gain full administrative control over your device — root access. A user with root access can easily bypass security features built into the operating system, read process memory or access restricted areas, such as the internal storage. Once an attacker has root access, any efforts to mitigate threats become futile. No application can be called safe under these circumstances, no matter how strong the encryption.",telegram
"How are secret chats different? Secret chats are meant for people who want more secrecy than the average fella. All messages in secret chats use end-to-end encryption. This means only you and the recipient can read those messages — nobody else can decipher them, including us here at Telegram (more on this here). On top of this, Messages cannot be forwarded from secret chats. And when you delete messages on your side of the conversation, the app on the other side of the secret chat will be ordered to delete them as well. You can order your messages, photos, videos and files to self-destruct in a set amount of time after they have been read or opened by the recipient. The message will then disappear from both your and your friend's devices. All secret chats in Telegram are device-specific and are not part of the Telegram cloud. This means you can only access messages in a secret chat from their device of origin. They are safe for as long as your device is safe in your pocket.",telegram
"How do I start a secret chat? Open the profile of the user you want to contact. Tap on ‘…’, then ‘Start Secret Chat’. Remember that Telegram secret chats are device-specific. If you start a secret chat with a friend on one of your devices, this chat will only be available on that device. If you log out, you will lose all your secret chats. You can create as many different secret chats with the same contact as you like.",telegram
"How do self-destructing messages work? The Self-Destruct Timer is available for all messages in Secret Chats and for media in private cloud chats. To set the timer, simply tap the clock icon (in the input field on iOS, top bar on Android), and then choose the desired time limit. The clock starts ticking the moment the message is displayed on the recipient's screen (gets two check marks). As soon as the time runs out, the message disappears from both devices. We will try to send a notification if a screenshot is taken. Please note that the timer in Secret Chats only applies to messages that were sent after the timer was set. It has no effect on earlier messages.",telegram
"Can I be certain that my conversation partner doesn't take a screenshot? Unfortunately, there is no bulletproof way of detecting screenshots on certain systems (most notably, some Android and Windows Phone devices). We will make every effort to alert you about screenshots taken in your Secret Chats, but it may still be possible to bypass such notifications and take screenshots silently. We advise to share sensitive information only with people you trust. After all, nobody can stop a person from taking a picture of their screen with a different device or an old school camera.",telegram
"What is this Encryption Key thing? When a secret chat is created, the participating devices exchange encryption keys using the so-called Diffie-Hellman key exchange. After the secure end-to-end connection has been established, we generate a picture that visualizes the encryption key for your chat. You can then compare this image with the one your friend has — if the two images are the same, you can be sure that the secret chat is secure, and no man-in-the-middle attack can succeed. Newer versions of Telegram apps will show a larger picture along with a textual representation of the key (this is not the key itself, of course!) when both participants are using an updated app. Always compare visualizations using a channel that is known to be secure — it's safest if you do this in person, in an offline meeting with the conversation partner.",telegram
"How do I change my phone number? You can change your number in Telegram and keep everything, including all your contacts, messages, and media from the Telegram cloud, as well as all your Secret Chats on all devices. To change your number, go to Settings, then tap on your phone number (just above the username), then click Change Number. If you already have a different Telegram account on the target number, you'll need to delete that account first.",telegram
"How do I delete my account? If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page. Deleting your account permanently removes all your messages and contacts. All groups and channels that you've created are orphaned and left without a creator but admins retain their rights. This action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.",telegram
"What happens if I delete my account? As was just mentioned above, all your data will be flushed from our system: all messages, groups, and contacts associated with your account will be deleted. That said, your contacts will still be able to chat in the groups that you have created, and they will still have their copy of the messages you sent them. So if you want to send messages that can vanish without a trace, try using our self-destruct timer instead. Termination of a Telegram account is irreversible. If you sign up again, you will appear as a new user and will not get your history, contacts or groups back. People, who have your phone number in their contacts, will be notified. The new user will be displayed as a separate conversation in their messages list and their conversation history with this new user will be empty.",telegram
"How does account self-destruction work? Telegram is not a commercial organization, and we value our disk space greatly. If you stop using Telegram and don't come online for at least 18 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud. You can change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct in Settings.",telegram
What are bots? Bots are like small programs that run right inside Telegram. They are made by third-party developers using the Telegram Bot API.,telegram
"How do I create a bot? Creating Telegram bots is super-easy, but you will need at least some skills in computer programming. If you're sure you're up to it, our Introduction for Developers is a good place to start. Unfortunately, there are no out-of-the-box ways to create a working bot if you are not a developer. But we're sure you'll soon find plenty of bots created by other people to play with.",telegram
"A bot is sending me messages, how do I make it stop? If you don't want a bot to send you messages, feel free to block it – same as you would block a human user. Some Telegram clients have a Stop Bot button right in the bot's profile. That said, most bot developers offer commands that silence the bot, check its  in help for clues.",telegram
"Where can I find more bots? There is no official store at the moment, so you'll have to ask your friends or search the web for now. We're pretty sure you'll find some bots to play with.",telegram

Браслет – универсальный пропуск для прохода через турникеты, открытия\закрытия шкафчика в раздевалке, в некоторых клубах для въезда на парковку. В большинстве наших клубов вы получите браслет. Пластиковая клубная карта при каждом визите обменивается на рецепции клуба на механический ключ от шкафчика в раздевалке. Пластиковой картой невозможно открыть электронный замок в раздевалке, но в некоторых клубах этот вариант более удобен для въезда на парковку.

3. **Audit Impact**: The matter influenced the overall audit strategy, resource allocation, and the engagement team's efforts during the audit.

4. **No Separate Opinion**: The audit report does not provide a separate opinion on these matters; instead, they are addressed within the context of the audit of the financial statements as a whole.",brave
"The passage identifies incorrect revenue recognition as a key audit matter due to its significance and the risk of fraud or error. It details the potential risks, such as incorrect recognition in the wrong period, non-compliance with IFRS 15, and manipulation around year-end. The audit addressed this risk by evaluating the group's revenue recognition accounting policy, specifically assessing compliance with IFRS 15 and testing the treatment of revenue streams under principal versus agent criteria.",brave
"This passage describes various procedures for auditing revenue recognition under IFRS 15:

1. Evaluating the group's revenue recognition accounting policy to ensure compliance with IFRS 15.

2. At the year-end, the total net book value of intangible assets, including goodwill, was £6.270m (with goodwill at £5.015m, as detailed in note 13).
3. The impairment assessment process, as per IAS 36, is complex, involving forecasting cash flows, determining discount rates, and making assumptions, which are highly judgmental.
4. Given the history of significant impairment adjustments, there is a significant risk of impairment of intangible assets.
5. The audit work included assessments related to this process but was not limited to it.",brave
"The passage states that due to the previous history of impairment adjustments, there is a significant risk of impairment in intangible assets. The audit work included:

1. Critically assessing whether management could reliably estimate the fair value of intangible assets acquired in the Greenlight Digital and Greenlight Commerce acquisitions.

5. The disclosures about these intangible assets in the financial statements were considered adequate.",brave
"The passage states that the independent auditors have assessed the disclosures in the financial statements related to the acquisition of Best Response Media Limited and found them adequate. The acquisition was identified as a significant risk due to its complex nature. The auditors' work included obtaining and critically assessing management's accounting entries, reviewing the Sales and Purchase Agreement, and reperforming management's goodwill calculation.",brave
"This passage outlines several audit procedures to be performed during an audit, specifically for an acquisition:

1. Review and agree accounting entries based on the Sales and Purchase Agreement.

4. Evaluate management's assessment of pro-rated profit and loss figures included in the consolidated financial statements.
5. Conduct specific audit procedures, such as cut-off testing, to ensure the accuracy of the acquired entities' figures in the consolidated financial statements.",brave
"This passage states that the auditor has performed specific audit procedures, such as cut-off testing, to ensure the accuracy of the figures of acquired entities included in the consolidated financial statements. They also evaluated the accounting policy and disclosures to confirm compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 3 Business Combinations.

3. This process is complex and highly judgemental, significantly affecting the results of the impairment review.
4. Impairment of investments is identified as a significant risk.
5. The audit work involved obtaining and recalculating management's cash flow forecasts used in the impairment assessment.",brave
"The passage states that due to the complexity of the process, impairment of investments was identified as a significant risk. The audit work involved obtaining and recalculating management's cash flow forecasts, reviewing board minutes, discussing the strategy for investments with management, challenging management's assumptions in the impairment models, performing a sensitivity analysis, and comparing the calculated value in use for the investment to its carrying value.",brave
"The passage describes three key audit processes:

1. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Checking if management's forecasts would still show positive headroom even if the assumptions varied (increased or decreased).
2. **Impairment Review**: Comparing the carrying value of the investment to its calculated value in use to ensure no impairment exists.
3. **Compliance and Disclosures**: Evaluating the accounting policy and disclosures to ensure they meet the requirements of FRS 102 and are consistent with the results of the impairment review.

The key observations conclude that:

- The carrying value of the company's investments is not materially misstated at the year-end.
- The management's impairment assessment is appropriate.
- The disclosures in the financial statements are considered adequate.",brave
"The passage states that the disclosures in the financial statements are considered adequate, and the application of materiality significantly influenced the scope and focus of the audit.

They must disclose relevant matters if applicable and use the going concern basis of accounting unless they intend to liquidate the group or parent company, or have no alternative but to cease operations. It also mentions the auditor's responsibilities, but specifically for the audit of the financial statements. The auditor's responsibilities include verifying the directors' assessment of going concern and ensuring the financial statements reflect the correct basis of accounting.",brave
"The passage states that auditors have the responsibility to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatements, due to fraud or error. This assurance is not a guarantee but a high level of certainty. The auditors must issue an opinion on the financial statements and, if material misstatements are found, address them in the auditor's report. Misstatements are considered material if they could influence the economic decisions of users based on the financial statements. For more detailed information, users are directed to the Financial Reporting Council's (FRC) website.",brave

2. **Fee Based Service Revenue:**
   - For social media and influencer services, including consultancy, strategy, and management services, revenue is recognized over the period in which the performance obligations for providing these services are satisfied.",brave
"The passage states that the company's revenue recognition for different services is as follows:

1. **Social Media and Influencer Services**: Revenue is recognized over time as the performance obligations to provide services are satisfied.
2. **License Fee Revenues**: Revenue for the company's own content and third-party content is recognized at the point in time when the content delivery obligation is satisfied.
3. **Performance Marketing Services**: Revenue is recognized over time as the performance obligations to provide services are satisfied.
4. **Technology Services**: Revenue is recognized over time as the performance obligations to provide services are satisfied.

Additionally, the text mentions that **interest and dividend income** is recognized when earned.",brave
"The passage explains three accounting practices related to financial reporting:

1. **Revenue from Technology Services**: Revenue is recognized over time as the performance obligations for providing services are satisfied.

2. **Interest and Dividend Income**:
   - **Interest income and expenses**: These are reported on an accrual basis using the effective interest method.
   - **Dividend income**: Except for investments in associates, it is recognized when the right to receive payment is established.

3. **Government Grants**: They are recognized at the fair value of the asset received or receivable when there is reasonable assurance that the grant conditions will be met and the grants will be received.",brave
"The passage explains the recognition and presentation of government grants under accounting standards. It states:

1. Government grants are recognized at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that grant conditions will be met and the grants will be received.
2. Grants with performance conditions are recognized in income when those conditions are met.
3. Grants without performance conditions are recognized in income when the proceeds are received or receivable.
4. Grants received before meeting recognition criteria are recorded as a liability.
5. Government grants are presented as a deduction from related expenses.
6. It also briefly mentions foreign currency translation, but no specific details about it are provided in the text. The focus is on government grants.",brave
"The passage explains how foreign currency transactions are translated according to different rules:

1. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction.
2. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.
3. Non-monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction.
4. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate on the date when the fair value was determined.

It also notes that any exchange differences arising from these translations are recognized in profit or loss in the period they occur.",brave
"This passage explains the treatment of foreign exchange differences in financial statements:

1. **Settlement and Translation Differences**: Exchange differences arising from the settlement of monetary items or translation at different rates are recognized in the profit or loss in the period they occur.

2. **Translation of Foreign Subsidiaries**: Assets, liabilities, and related goodwill of foreign subsidiaries are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at the actual exchange rate on the date of the transaction.

3. **Revaluation and Translation Reserves**: Exchange differences from retranslations of the opening net investment in subsidiaries and year-end income and expenses are recognized in other comprehensive income and recorded in the ""translation reserve"" of equity.

4. **Disposal of Foreign Operations**: On disposal of a foreign operation, any cumulative translation differences, including gains or losses from related hedges, are transferred to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.

The final part, ""4.5. Segment reporting,"" is not directly related to the foreign exchange differences discussed but appears to be the title for a separate section on segment reporting.",brave
"This passage discusses the application of IFRS 8, Operating Segments, in identifying and reporting operating segments. It states that the operating segments must align with the criteria used internally for performance review and resource allocation by the chief executive (CODM). The group's senior executive team views the business through two key pillars: Media Network and Digital Advertising and Technology Services. The passage also mentions that the group provides a split of revenues between these two pillars, as well as by geographical location, in accordance with IFRS 8. It concludes by noting that this segmental information is presented in Note 6 for all periods covered. It briefly touches on leasing in section 4.6, but does not provide specific details about leasing.",brave
"The passage explains that for new contracts entered into on or after 1 January 2019, the Group must determine if a contract constitutes a lease. A lease is defined as a contract (or part of a contract) that grants the right to use an asset for a specific period in exchange for consideration. To classify a contract as a lease, the Group evaluates three key criteria:

1. The contract must have an identified asset, either explicitly mentioned or implied by its availability at the time of use.
2. The Group must have the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset throughout the agreed period.
3. The evaluation involves considering the Group's rights within the scope of the defined contract.",brave
"This passage explains the criteria for recognizing a right-of-use asset and a lease liability under lease accounting standards. It states:

1. The Group has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset and can direct its use throughout the lease period.
2. At lease commencement, the Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet.
3. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which includes:
   - The initial measurement of the lease liability.
   - Any initial direct costs incurred by the Group.
   - An estimate of any costs to dismantle and remove the asset at the end of the lease.
   - Any lease payments made in advance of the lease commencement date (adjusted for any incentives received).",brave
"The passage describes the accounting treatment for right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Here are the key points:

1. **Depreciation of Right-of-Use Assets**: The Group depreciates these assets on a straight-line basis from the lease commencement date to either the end of the lease term or the useful life of the asset, whichever comes first.

2. **Impairment Testing**: The Group assesses the right-of-use asset for impairment if there are indicators of impairment.

3. **Measurement of Lease Liability at Commencement**: At the lease commencement, the Group measures the lease liability as the present value of all future lease payments, discounted using either the interest rate implicit in the lease (if available) or the Group's incremental borrowing rate.

4. **Components of Lease Payments**: The lease payments included in the liability measurement consist of fixed payments, variable payments based on an index or rate, residual value guarantees, and payments from options that are reasonably certain to be exercised.

These points summarize the passage's content regarding lease accounting treatments.",brave
"The passage explains the treatment of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets under accounting standards. Key points include:

1. **Liability Changes**: The liability is reduced as payments are made and increased for interest. It is remeasured if there are changes in fixed payments or reassessments/ modifications.

2. **Remeasurement Impact**: Any adjustment due to remeasurement is reflected in the right-of-use asset or profit and loss if the right-of-use asset is already reduced to zero.

3. **Practical Expedients**: For short-term leases and low-value assets, the Group uses practical expedients, recognizing lease payments as expenses over the lease term rather than recognizing right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.

4. **Financial Reporting**: On the balance sheet, right-of-use assets are included in property, plant, and equipment, and lease liabilities are included in trade and other payables.",brave
"The passage states the following:

1. Right-of-use assets are included in the category of property, plant, and equipment on the statement of financial position.
2. Lease liabilities are included in the category of trade and other payables.
3. Property, plant, and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.
4. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the expected useful lives, with different rates for fixtures & fittings (3 years or over the remaining lease term) and computer equipment (3 years).
5. Gain or loss on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant, and equipment is determined by the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, and is recognized in profit or loss.",brave
"The passage discusses the accounting treatment for the disposal or retirement of property, plant, and equipment. It states that the gain or loss is determined by the difference between sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, and is recognized in profit or loss. The residual value and useful lives of assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date, and the carrying amount is written down if it exceeds the recoverable amount. The passage also mentions that right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis and are assessed for impairment when necessary. The section specifically mentions impairment of property, plant, and equipment.",brave
"This passage discusses the process that a Group follows to check if their property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) have suffered any impairment. Here's a summary:

1. At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its PP&E.
2. If there's any indication of impairment, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated.
3. The recoverable amount is the higher of:
   - Fair value less costs of disposal
   - Value in use
4. If the recoverable amount cannot be estimated for an individual asset, it's estimated for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
5. Value in use is assessed by discounting estimated future cash flows to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that considers market assessments of time value of money and asset-specific risks.",brave
"The passage explains the accounting treatment for impairments of assets or cash-generating units:

1. **Impairment Recognition**: If the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss, and the asset's carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount.

2. **Reversal of Impairment**: If an impairment loss previously recognized is reversed, the asset's carrying amount is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but it cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined without any prior impairment loss.

3. **Specific Context**: This process applies to intangible assets as well, though the text does not explicitly state so; it is implied by the context of discussing assets and cash-generating units.",brave
"The passage describes the recognition, valuation, and impairment process for intangible assets. Key points include:

1. **Recognition**: Intangible assets are recognized if it is probable that they will generate future economic benefits and if their cost can be reliably measured.
2. **Identifiability**: An intangible asset is considered identifiable if it is separable or arises from legal rights.
3. **Acquisition and Valuation**: Intangible assets acquired through a business combination are valued at fair value at the acquisition date, less accumulated amortization.
4. **Amortization**: Amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis and is charged to profit or loss over their estimated useful lives:
   - Customer relationships: 5 to 10 years
   - Online channel content: 3 to 5 years
   - Brands: 3 years
   - Technology: 1 to 5 years
5. **Goodwill**: Unlike intangible assets, goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually.
6. **Impairment**: Impairment of intangible assets is reviewed on an annual basis as outlined in section 4.9.",brave
"The passage describes the following key points:
- Customer relationships and online channel content have expected useful lives of 5 to 10 years and 3 to 5 years, respectively.
- Brands have a useful life of 3 years.
- Technology has a useful life of 1 to 5 years.
- Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed annually for impairment.
- The Group reviews intangible assets' carrying amounts on each balance sheet date to check for impairment, estimating the recoverable amount if necessary. If estimation is not possible for an individual asset, the recoverable amount of the corresponding cash-generating unit is estimated instead.",brave
"The passage explains that the recoverable amount of an asset is determined by comparing its fair value less costs of disposal to its value in use. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.

Key points:
1. **Recoverable Amount**: The higher of fair value less costs of disposal or value in use.
2. **Value in Use**: Estimated future cash flows discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate.
3. **Impairment Loss**: Recognized if recoverable amount is less than carrying amount.

**Regarding Development Costs:**
- Research phase expenditures are expensed as incurred.
- Development costs on specific projects are capitalized if:
  - Completion is technically feasible.
  - The Group intends to complete the asset for use or sale.",brave
"The passage states the following criteria for capitalizing development costs of an asset:

1. The completion of the asset is technically feasible and will be available for use or sale.
2. The Group intends to complete the asset and use or sell it.
3. The Group has the ability to use or sell the asset and it will generate probable future economic benefits (over and above cost).
4. There are adequate technical, financial, and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset.
5. The expenditure attributable to the asset during its development can be measured reliably.

Assets that do not meet these criteria have development costs that are expensed as incurred. The cost of an internally generated asset includes all directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce, and prepare the asset to operate as intended by management. Directly attributable costs include employee costs (excluding Directors) and third-party costs.",brave
"This passage discusses several accounting practices and processes:

1. **Judgement by the Directors**: The Directors evaluate whether development costs meet the recognition requirements based on the information available when the costs are incurred.

2. **Monitoring of Research and Development**: All internal activities related to the research and development of new projects are continuously monitored by the Directors.

3. **Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures**: These investments are accounted for using the equity method. The carrying amount is adjusted to reflect the Group's share of the investee's profit or loss and other comprehensive income, ensuring consistency with the Group's accounting policies.

4. **Taxation**: Tax expenses recognized in profit or loss include the sum of current tax payable and deferred tax that is not recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.",brave
"This passage describes the recognition and calculation of tax expenses in financial statements. It states:

1. **Tax expenses recognized in profit or loss** include both the current tax payable and deferred tax.
2. **Current tax** is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit is adjusted from the reported profit to exclude items that are taxable or deductible in other years or are never taxable or deductible.
3. **Deferred tax** is not explicitly defined in this passage but is mentioned as part of the tax expenses recognized in profit or loss, along with current tax. It typically refers to future tax consequences arising from temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities.

The passage also notes that the Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.",brave
"This passage explains the recognition of deferred tax in financial statements:

1. Deferred tax is recognized for differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in financial statements and their tax bases.
2. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for taxable temporary differences.
3. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for deductible temporary differences, provided there is a probable taxable profit to offset these differences.
4. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognized if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction affecting neither taxable nor accounting profit.
5. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for investments in subsidiaries, except in cases where the Group can control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
6. Deferred tax assets associated with investments in subsidiaries are only recognized to the extent there is a probable sufficient taxable profit to offset the difference and it is expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.",brave
"This passage explains the process and considerations for the accounting treatment of deferred tax assets and liabilities:

1. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed periodically (at each reporting date) and reduced if it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to recover the asset.
2. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates that are expected to apply during the period when the liability is settled or the asset is recognized, based on enacted or substantially enacted tax laws at the balance sheet date.
3. The measurement reflects the tax consequences expected to occur based on how the company plans to recover or settle its assets and liabilities.
4. Deferred tax assets and liabilities can be offset if there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, they relate to income taxes from the same taxation authority, and the company intends to settle these on a net basis.",brave
"This passage explains the recognition and derecognition of financial instruments, specifically financial assets and financial liabilities. Here's a summary:

- **Recognition**: Financial assets and liabilities are recognized when the Group becomes a party to the financial instrument.
- **Derecognition of Financial Assets**: They are derecognized when the contractual rights expire or when the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards.
- **Derecognition of Financial Liabilities**: They are derecognized when extinguished, discharged, cancelled, or expire.
- **Loan and Other Receivables**: The Group records a loss allowance for loan and other receivables as lifetime expected credit losses, based on potential defaults considering historical experience, external indicators, and forward-looking information.
- **Trade and Other Payables**: The passage does not provide specific accounting rules for trade and other payables, only mentioning their existence in the context of financial instruments.",brave
"This passage discusses financial accounting practices related to trade and payables, contract assets and liabilities, and equity and dividends:

1. **Trade and Other Payables**: These are initially measured at fair value and then subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
2. **Contract Assets and Liabilities**: The Group does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for a significant financing component if the expected payment period is one year or less.
3. **Equity, Reserves, and Dividend Payments**:
   - **Share Capital**: Represents the nominal value of issued shares.
   - **Share Premium**: Includes any premiums received over nominal value, net of transaction costs and related income tax benefits.
   - **Retained Deficits**: This likely refers to accumulated losses that have not been offset by profits in the company’s financial statements.",brave
"The passage describes several types of reserves or accounts in a company's financial statement:
1. **Share premium**: Any premiums received on the issue of share capital, net of transaction costs and income tax benefits.
2. **Retained deficits**: Includes all current and prior period retained profits or losses, along with credits from share-based payment charges.
3. **Translation reserve**: Represents differences arising from translating investments in overseas subsidiaries.
4. **Merger reserve**: Created when group reconstruction accounting is applied; it recognizes the difference between the cost of investment and the nominal value of share capital acquired.
5. **Merger relief reserve**: Any excess consideration received over the nominal value of shares issued is recognized in this reserve under specific conditions.",brave
"This passage explains three accounting entries related to company reserves and dividend distributions:

1. **Merger Relief Reserve:** Any excess consideration received over the nominal value of shares issued in a merger, where the issuer obtains at least a 90% equity holding in the other company, is recognized in the merger relief reserve.

2. **Capital Redemption Reserve:** When a company purchases and cancels its own equity shares, the nominal value of the shares is deducted from share capital and transferred to the capital redemption reserve.

3. **Dividend Distributions:** Dividends payable to equity shareholders are recorded as 'other liabilities' if they have been approved in a general meeting prior to the reporting date.

4. **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** This likely refers to a section or subsection indicating that the company's cash and cash equivalents are being managed or reported as part of the financial statements. However, the text provided does not contain specific details about how cash and cash equivalents are handled or presented; it may be a placeholder for further explanation or a summary.",brave
"The passage provides information about three accounting entries related to financial reporting:

1. **Dividend Distributions**: Dividends payable to equity shareholders that have been approved in a general meeting prior to the reporting date are included in 'other liabilities'.

2. **Cash and Cash Equivalents**: These include cash in hand, deposits with banks, and highly liquid investments with maturities of 3 months or less.

3. **Employee Benefits**: The Group offers private healthcare and a defined contribution pension plan, with expenses incurred through these schemes expensed as they become due.

4. **Share Based Payments**: The passage mentions ""Share based payments,"" but it does not provide specific details about how these are treated in the reporting.",brave
"The passage discusses employee benefits and share-based payments for the Group. It mentions:

1. **Employee Benefits**: The Group offers two schemes for its employees: private healthcare and a defined contribution pension plan. These expenses are recognized as they become due.

2. **Share-Based Payments**: Employees, including directors, receive remuneration through share-based payment transactions, where they provide services in exchange for rights over shares. These transactions are treated as equity-settled. The Group follows the requirements of IFRS 2 for all grants of equity instruments.",brave
"The passage explains the accounting for equity-settled transactions with employees:

1. The cost of these transactions is based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the grant date, determined using the Black-Scholes method.
2. This cost is recognized over the period from the grant date to the end of the vesting period, as relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
3. The total value of options has been divided and allocated using a weighted average method.

It then mentions:

4. Restructuring costs relate to corporate re-organization activities, as detailed in note 8.
5. Provisions are also discussed, though their specific content is not detailed in the text provided.",brave
"This passage explains two financial concepts:

1. **Restructuring Costs**: These costs are related to corporate reorganisation activities that the company has undertaken or announced. Further details can be found in note 8.

2. **Provisions**: The Group has set aside funds for the costs needed to restore leased property to its original condition, as stipulated in the lease terms and conditions. This provision is recognised when the obligation is incurred and is based on the directors' best estimate of the expenditure required for restoration. The estimates are regularly reviewed and updated as necessary to reflect changes in circumstances.",brave
"This passage discusses the financial reporting process under UK adopted International Accounting Standards, emphasizing the need for estimates and assumptions in preparing financial statements. It highlights that these estimates and judgements are subject to continuous evaluation and are based on historical experience and other relevant factors, including expectations of future events that are deemed reasonable. The passage specifically addresses five critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty, with the first example focusing on intangible assets and impairment. 

Key points:
- The need for estimates and assumptions in financial statement preparation.
- Estimations and judgements are evaluated and based on historical and expected future events.
- Specific focus on intangible assets and impairment as a critical accounting judgement.
- Acknowledgement that actual results may differ from estimates.

In summary, the passage introduces the concept of critical accounting judgements with a specific example of intangible assets and impairment, emphasizing the uncertainties involved in financial reporting under UK IAS.",brave
"The passage discusses how the Group accounts for intangible assets acquired through business combinations, stating that these assets are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. The fair value is determined by experts using management's and directors' judgment, considering assumptions about future cash flows and an appropriate discount rate. Additionally, the passage mentions that management must estimate the useful lives of these intangible assets and charge amortization accordingly. It also briefly touches upon the topic of trade receivables' recovery, though without providing specific details.",brave
"The passage discusses the recovery of trade receivables where a balance of £0.7 million is over one year old but has not been provisioned due to the Group's belief that it is recoverable. This is based on the existence of a corresponding trade payable balance of £0.8 million with the same company, and the anticipation of reaching an agreement to set off these balances against each other. 

Additionally, the passage touches on the treatment of revenue as an agent or principal, although no specific details are provided regarding how this relates to the trade receivables recovery discussion.",brave
"The passage discusses three main topics:

1. **Treatment of Revenue as Agent or Principal**: It explains that determining whether a group is acting as a principal or an agent in a transaction requires assessing control over a good or service before it is transferred to a customer. Key indicators include the group's responsibility in fulfilling the promise, inventory risk, and discretion in setting prices.

2. **Deferred Taxation**: It states that deferred tax assets are recognized only if there is a probable realization of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits.

3. **Greenlight Acquisition and Purchase Price Allocation**: This topic is not fully detailed in the passage. However, it mentions that a greenlight acquisition and purchase price allocation have occurred, which typically refers to the process of allocating the purchase price of an acquired company when assets and liabilities are identified and valued.",brave
"The passage discusses three main points:

1. **Deferred Tax Assets**: It explains that deferred tax assets are recognized only for tax loss carryforwards that are probable to be realized through future taxable profits.

2. **Greenlight Acquisition**: The purchase price allocation for the Greenlight acquisition was completed within the IFRS 3 measurement period from the date of acquisition. The intangibles, specifically the trade name and customer relationships, were identified and valued, leading to a reallocation of the purchase price.

3. **Best Response Media Acquisition**: The text mentions the acquisition but does not provide specific details about the purchase price allocation process for this acquisition.",brave
"The passage discusses the purchase price allocation of a Best Response Media acquisition. The Group initially provisionally assessed the allocation but could not reliably estimate the fair value of acquired intangibles at the interim valuation stage. As a result, the excess consideration over the fair value of other assets and liabilities was allocated to goodwill. The passage also notes that a full valuation exercise will be completed within the IFRS3 measurement period to potentially recognize additional intangible assets separately from goodwill. Additionally, it mentions estimates related to share-based payment charges.",brave
"The passage discusses the process and factors involved in estimating share based payment charges for the Group. It mentions:

1. The requirement to measure the fair value of share-based payments.
2. The use of the Black-Scholes method for determining this fair value.
3. Assumptions made for the Black-Scholes method, including:
   - Exchange rate volatility, based on historic data over the past three years.
   - Risk-free rate, ranging from 0% to 1.25%.
   - Share price volatility, estimated as the average of similar listed companies over preceding periods.
   - Expected life of the share-based payment, estimated to be 4 years by management, including the Directors.

Additionally, the passage briefly references ""bad debt provision,"" but this seems to be an unrelated statement about estimating share based payment charges. The primary focus is on the estimation process for share-based payment charges.",brave
"The passage explains that when managing financial risks, companies may have to set aside funds known as bad debt provisions for receivables that might not be fully recoverable. This is done when the management judges that there is a doubt about the receivables being fully collected. The provision amount is determined based on past experiences but is also subjective, as it involves assessing the level of doubt.",brave
"The passage discusses segment reporting for the Group, breaking down revenue by geographic areas (United Kingdom & Europe, Asia Pacific, and Rest of the world) and by revenue streams (Advertising and Fee based services). Here are the key points:

1. **Geographic Reporting:**

**Investment Strategy:**
- The company's investment mandate includes natural resources but is not exclusively limited to this sector.
- The Board believes in the growth potential of the natural resources sector in the medium term.
- Historically, investments were made before and after initial public offerings on AIM or AQSE.

"This passage explains that when investing in shares of companies listed on markets like AIM, AQSE, ASX, or TSX-V, investors often face a lack of liquidity due to small trading volumes. This means that it is difficult to sell these shares quickly at the quoted market price in the early stages of investment. The passage suggests that investors need to be patient as the invested company develops and gains more market interest, which could lead to increased liquidity. It also notes that if an exploration company discovers a large, exploitable resource, it can become a more attractive acquisition target or a more actively traded entity, thereby offering higher liquidity to patient investors.",starvest

2. Have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP).
3. Adhere to the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

The basis for the opinion is not explicitly mentioned in the text, but it is implied to be the auditor's professional judgment based on their examination of the financial statements.",starvest
"The passage states that:

1. The financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP).
2. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
3. The audit was conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law.
4. The auditor is independent of the company according to the relevant ethical requirements, including the FRC's Ethical Standard for listed entities.
5. The audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to support the auditor's opinion.
6. There are conclusions related to the going concern aspect of the financial statements.",starvest
"The passage states that in auditing the financial statements, it has been concluded that the Director's use of the going concern basis is appropriate. The auditors evaluated the Directors' assessment of the company's ability to continue using this basis by reviewing cash flow forecasts and assessing the realization of Level 1 investments if necessary. No material uncertainties have been identified that could cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern for at least twelve months from the statement date.",starvest
"This passage states that the report describes the responsibilities related to the company's going concern as well as the responsibilities of directors. It also mentions that the scope of the audit was determined by the application of materiality, which includes both quantitative and qualitative thresholds influencing the nature, timing, and extent of the audit procedures.",starvest
"The passage states that the materiality limit for the company's financial statements was set at £184,000, down from £422,000 in the previous year. This limit was calculated as 3% of net assets, with equity investments being the main component. The basis for calculating materiality remained unchanged, reflecting a decrease in the fair value of equity investments. The benchmark for materiality was determined as the key benchmark for assessing the financial performance of an investment management company, focusing on equity investments. Performance materiality was set at £128,800, representing 70% of the headline materiality, based on risk assessment and the absence of audit adjustments in previous periods.",starvest
"This passage indicates that the independent auditor agreed to report to the governing authorities any misstatements, both corrected and uncorrected, with a value over £9,000, and any other misstatements below that threshold if they deemed them significant qualitatively. The passage also mentions the auditor's approach to the audit, including the determination of materiality and the assessment of risks related to significant judgements made by the directors, particularly regarding the fair value of investments, and the risk of management overriding internal controls. The text concludes by referencing ""key audit matters,"" though they are not detailed in the provided excerpt.",starvest
"The passage explains that key audit matters are significant issues in an audit that were identified by the auditors. These matters include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or not. They impact the overall audit strategy, resource allocation, and the engagement team's efforts. The matters are addressed during the audit of the financial statements and are considered when forming the auditor's opinion. However, the auditor does not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The text also includes a table to show how the scope of the audit addressed each key audit matter.",starvest
"The passage discusses a key audit matter related to financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss. Specifically, it highlights:

- The company holds equity investments with a carrying value of £6 million as of 30 September 2022.
- These investments are largely listed and classified under Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.
- The audit approach includes reviewing the valuation methodology for each type of investment and ensuring that the carrying values are supported by sufficient and appropriate audit evidence.",starvest
"The passage outlines several key audit aspects related to unlisted investments at an entity:

1. **Management Valuation and Estimation**: Unlisted investments are subject to management valuation, making them vulnerable to significant levels of management judgment and estimation.

2. **Categorisation and Disclosure**:
   - Ensuring correct categorisation and disclosure of investments according to UK GAAP.

3. **Writing Down to $Nil**:
   - Investments have previously been written down to £Nil, indicating historical impairment.

4. **Agreeing Year-End Fair Values**:
   - Ensuring year-end fair values are agreed with independent sources of price data.

5. **Significance and Key Audit Matter**:
   - Based on the significance of the investment value at the year-end, this is identified as a Key Audit Matter.

6. **Title Verification**:
   - Ensuring the company has legal title to the investments held.

7. **Investment Disposal Tests**:
   - Performing tests of detail on investment disposals in the year.

These points collectively emphasize the critical nature of audits related to unlisted investments, especially concerning valuation, disclosure, legal ownership, and disposal accuracy.",starvest
"This passage explains that:

1. The ""other information"" in an annual report includes everything except the financial statements and the auditor's report on them.
2. The Directors are responsible for this other information.
3. The auditor's opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information.
4. The auditor reads the other information to check for any material inconsistencies with the financial statements or knowledge obtained during the audit.
5. If the auditor finds material inconsistencies or misstatements, they are required to determine if it affects the financial statements.
6. If a material misstatement is found in the other information, the auditor must report it.",starvest
"The passage indicates that the independent auditor has conducted an audit of Starvest PLC and finds:

1. There is nothing to report in the strategic report and directors' report regarding consistency with the financial statements.
2. The strategic report and directors' report are in compliance with legal requirements.
3. They have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or directors' report.
4. There is nothing to report on the matters specified by the Companies Act 2006 for which they are required to report an exception.",starvest
"The passage states that as per the Companies Act 2006, the organization does not need to report on the following matters unless specific conditions are met:

1. If adequate accounting records have not been kept or if returns adequate for the audit have not been received from branches not visited.
2. If the financial statements do not agree with the accounting records and returns.
3. If certain disclosures of directors' remuneration, as specified by law, are not made.
4. If all the information and explanations required for the audit have not been received.

Additionally, it explains that directors are responsible for preparing the financial statements and ensuring they give a true and fair view, along with establishing appropriate internal control systems to prevent material misstatement.",starvest
"The passage states that the directors of a company are responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern. They must disclose any relevant matters related to going concern and use the going concern basis of accounting unless they plan to liquidate the company, cease operations, or have no realistic alternative to do so. The text does not directly address the auditor's responsibilities but implies that an audit is conducted to verify these assessments. 

To summarize the auditor's responsibilities mentioned:

1. The auditor is responsible for auditing the financial statements.
2. This includes verifying the directors' assessments regarding the going concern.
3. The auditor's reports should reflect the directors' disclosures and the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting.",starvest
"The passage outlines the auditor's responsibilities during the audit of financial statements. The objectives include:

1. Obtaining reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement due to fraud or error.
2. Issuing an auditor's report that includes their professional opinion based on the audit findings.

It is clarified that reasonable assurance is not absolute and that an audit cannot guarantee detection of all material misstatements, particularly those resulting from fraud or error. Misstatements are considered material if they could influence the economic decisions of users based on the financial statements.",starvest
"The passage discusses the approach to detecting irregularities and fraud in the financial statements of Starvest PLC. It explains that the auditors have designed procedures to identify and detect material misstatements resulting from non-compliance with laws and regulations. Key points include:

1. The auditors have understood the company's operations and the sector in which it operates to identify relevant laws and regulations.
2. This understanding was obtained through discussions with management and the application of the auditors' collective experience.
3. The principal laws and regulations relevant to the company are identified as:
   - Companies Act 2006
   - FRS 102 (Financial Reporting Standard 102)
   - AIM Rules (Alternative Investment Market Rules)

These laws and regulations are considered to have a direct effect on the financial statements.",starvest
"The independent auditor's report to the members of Starvest PLC states that the auditor determined the relevant laws and regulations to be the Companies Act 2006, FRS 102, and AIM Rules. They designed audit procedures to check for compliance with these regulations, which included inquiries with management, reviewing board minutes, and examining related party transactions and disclosures. Additionally, the auditor identified risks of material misstatement due to fraud, focusing particularly on the risks associated with investments.",starvest
"The passage discusses the risk of fraud in financial reporting due to management overriding controls. It states that to address this risk, auditors perform various audit procedures such as testing journals and evaluating the business rationale of unusual transactions. However, it acknowledges that an audit has inherent limitations, meaning there's a risk that some irregularities might not be detected, particularly those leading to material misstatements or non-compliance with regulations. The risk of undetected irregularities increases when compliance with laws or regulations is not reflected in the financial statements and is more significant for fraud-related issues, as these involve intentional actions like concealment or misrepresentation.",starvest
"The passage states that the responsible auditor's report can be found on the Financial Reporting Council's website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. It also explains that the report is made solely for the company's members and is prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. The auditor, David Thompson, clarifies that there is no responsibility to anyone other than the company and its members for the audit work or report. The report was issued on February 15, 2023, for PKF Littlejohn LLP as the statutory auditor.",starvest

"This passage states that the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the United Kingdom accounting standards, specifically Financial Reporting Standard 102 (FRS102) and the Companies Act 2006. They have been prepared on a historical cost basis, with no fair value adjustments other than for trade investments. The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, the company's functional currency.

The company relies on its available cash resources and occasional short-term loans for financing. The directors are confident that adequate funding can be secured to meet current and future liabilities, as confirmed by the cash flow forecast for the next 12 months. If necessary, the company could raise funds by disposing of certain current assets.

As of the report date, the company has no borrowings. Based on these factors, the directors are satisfied that the company will be able to meet its liabilities and continue trading for at least 12 months from the report date. Therefore, preparing the financial statements on a going concern basis is considered appropriate.",starvest
"The passage outlines the accounting policies for administrative expenses, taxation, and investment valuation in a company. Here's a summary:

1. **Administrative Expenses**: All administrative expenses are stated inclusive of VAT where applicable, and the company is not eligible to reclaim VAT incurred on its costs.

2. **Taxation**:
   - Corporation tax is provided on taxable profits at current enacted rates at the balance sheet date.
   - Under FRS102, investments are valued on a mark-to-market basis using publicly quoted trading prices at year-end.
   - For trading companies, any increase in the value of a current asset is recognized as a trading profit and subject to Corporation Tax immediately. For investment companies, such increases are not subject to taxation until the asset is disposed of.

3. **Investment Valuation**:
   - Under UK GAAP, reported profit remains unaffected by tax implications of investment value changes.",starvest
"The passage indicates that the Company's board has reclassified the investment portfolio from a current asset to a fixed asset, based on a comprehensive review of the portfolio's characteristics. This reclassification reflects a change in the presentation of the investment portfolio rather than a change in accounting policy, as it is considered more accurate in reflecting the factual position of the portfolio. The passage also mentions ""Deferred tax,"" which suggests that the reclassification might impact the company's tax liabilities or assets.",starvest
"The passage explains that deferred tax is calculated and recognized on an undiscounted full provision basis for all timing differences existing at the balance sheet date, using the current tax rates. Deferred tax assets are recognized only if it is probable they will be recovered, typically against future taxable profits or the reversal of existing liabilities, and these are listed within debtors. The assets and liabilities related to the same entity and tax authority are offset on the balance sheet.",starvest
"The passage discusses the following:

1. **Mark-to-Market Valuation and Profit Recognition**: FRS 102 requires that investments be valued on a mark-to-market basis each year, and any revaluation differences are reflected in the profit and loss account. However, tax on unrealised profits is calculated as if the profit had been realised, with an adjustment to the deferred tax on the balance sheet to account for this unrealised profit.

2. **Foreign Currencies**: Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency based on the exchange rate at the reporting date, unless foreign exchange contracts are in place, in which case the contract rate is used.

3. **Investments**: Current investments are stated at mid-market publicly quoted prices.",starvest
"This passage describes the valuation and accounting treatment of investments:

1. **Current investments** are valued at mid-market publicly quoted prices.
2. **Unlisted company shares** are valued either at available market values or at Directors' valuations at each balance sheet date.

As of 30 September 2022, the unlisted shares were valued at £nil (compared to £nil in 2021).
3. **Listed company shares** are valued at market value at each balance sheet date, under level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Any gains or losses from revaluation are also recognized in the statement of comprehensive income for the period.
4. **Dividend income** is recognized in the income statement when the right to receive payment is established from investee companies.

Additionally, it mentions the accounting treatment for **financial instruments**, specifically **trade and other receivables**.",starvest
"This passage explains the recognition and measurement of:

1. **Dividend Income**: Dividend income is recognized in the income statement when the right to receive payment from investee companies is established.
2. **Trade and Other Receivables**: These are recognized initially at fair value and measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, with a provision for impairment.

6. **Segmental Analysis**: 
   - The passage mentions ""segmental information"" but does not provide further detail about it other than that it is part of section 4.",starvest
"The passage describes the concept of ""Retained Earnings"" and explains that it represents the cumulative profit or loss that is not distributed as dividends but is instead saved for future use and is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income. Additionally, it discusses ""Segmental Analysis"" and states that the company operates as a single segment based in the UK with a primary activity to invest in businesses for shareholder returns. Since the company has no other operating segments, no segmental analysis has been disclosed. The directors plan to review and update the segmental analysis as needed.",starvest

3. A subsidiary is defined as an entity over which the consolidated entity has control.
4. Control is established when the consolidated entity has the ability to significantly influence an entity's returns through its power to direct its activities.
5. Subsidiaries are fully included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of control transfer and exclude from the date control ceases.",rectifier
"This passage discusses accounting procedures for intercompany transactions and acquisitions within a consolidated entity. It states:

1. Intercompany transactions, balances, and unrealised gains are eliminated.
2. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction indicates potential impairment of the asset transferred.
3. Accounting policies of subsidiaries are adjusted to ensure consistency with the consolidated entity's policies.
4. Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method.
5. Changes in ownership without losing control are treated as equity transactions, with the difference recognized directly in the parent's equity.

These points summarize the core accounting practices and transactions described in the text.",rectifier
"The passage explains that when a consolidated entity loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the subsidiary's assets, liabilities, non-controlling interest, and any translation differences. Instead, the consolidated entity recognizes the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained investment, along with any resulting gain or loss in profit or loss.",rectifier
"The passage explains the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers, outlining the steps the consolidated entity takes:

1. **Identify the contract** and its performance obligations.
2. **Determine the transaction price**, considering variable consideration and the time value of money.
3. **Allocate the transaction price** to each performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling price.
4. **Recognize revenue** when or as each performance obligation is satisfied.

It also discusses how **variable consideration** is estimated using the 'expected value' or 'most likely amount' method, and revenue is only recognized to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. If amounts received are subject to the constraining principle, they are recognized as a refund liability.",rectifier
"The passage explains that the income tax expense or benefit for a period is calculated based on the taxable income of that period, using the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction. It also includes adjustments for changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities due to temporary differences, unused tax losses, and prior period adjustments. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized at the expected tax rates for when the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled, unless they arise from specific transactions like the initial recognition of goodwill in a non-combination transaction.",rectifier
"This passage explains two specific scenarios for recognizing deferred income tax assets:

1. **Initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability**: Deferred income tax assets are recognized when the income tax asset or liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, but the transaction does not affect the accounting or taxable profits at the time of the transaction.

2. **Temporary differences with interests in subsidiaries, associates, or joint ventures**: Deferred income tax assets are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with interests in subsidiaries, associates, or joint ventures, if the timing of the reversal can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Additionally, it mentions that deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilize those temporary differences and losses.",rectifier
"This passage explains that deferred tax assets are recognized only if certain criteria are met:

1. Deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses must exist.
2. It must be probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilize these differences and losses.

Additionally, it describes ongoing reviews of deferred tax assets:

- The carrying amount of both recognized and unrecognised deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date.
- If it is no longer probable that future taxable profits will be available to recover the carrying amount, recognized deferred tax assets are reduced.
- Previously unrecognised deferred tax assets are recognized if it becomes probable that there will be future taxable profits to recover these assets.",rectifier
"This passage explains that Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset under specific conditions: 

1. There must be a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and deferred tax assets against deferred tax liabilities.
2. These assets and liabilities must relate to the same taxable authority.
3. The offset must involve the same taxable entity or different taxable entities that intend to settle simultaneously.

The passage also describes how Rectifier Technologies Ltd and its wholly-owned Australian subsidiaries, which form an income tax consolidated group, continue to account for their own current and deferred tax amounts. They use the ""separate taxpayer within group"" approach to allocate taxes among members of the tax consolidated group.",rectifier
"This passage explains that the head entity in a tax consolidated group recognizes both current tax liabilities (or assets) and deferred tax assets associated with unused tax losses and credits from each subsidiary. These amounts are included in the group's overall tax calculations. Additionally, tax funding agreements with the consolidated entities result in recognition of receivables or payables among group members, ensuring that the intercompany charge matches the current tax liability or benefit of each group member. This arrangement prevents the head entity from contributing to the subsidiaries or the subsidiaries from distributing to the head entity, maintaining a balanced tax liability within the group.",rectifier
"This passage explains the classification of assets and liabilities in a statement of financial position:

- Assets are classified as current if they are expected to be realized, sold, consumed, or held for trading purposes within 12 months after the reporting period, or if they are cash or cash equivalents not restricted from being exchanged or used to settle liabilities for at least 12 months. All other assets are classified as non-current.
- Liabilities are classified as current if they are expected to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period or if there is no unconditional right to defer their settlement for at least 12 months. All other liabilities are classified as non-current.
- Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always classified as non-current.",rectifier
"This passage discusses the accounting treatment for property, plant, and equipment (PP&E). It explains that freehold land is stated at historical cost and not depreciated, but it is tested for impairment if needed. Buildings and other PP&E are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis for items other than land, with specific periods provided for different types of assets:

- Buildings: 50 years
- Leasehold improvements: 10 years or unexpired lease period, whichever is shorter
- Plant and equipment: 2.5 to 5 years
- Motor vehicles: 5 years

Residual values, useful lives, and depreciation methods are reviewed and adjusted at each reporting date. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the unexpired lease period or their estimated useful life. PP&E is derecognized when it is disposed of or no longer brings future economic benefits to the entity, with any resulting gains or losses recognized in profit or loss.",rectifier
"The passage describes the accounting treatment for right-of-use assets under lease agreements:

1. **Recognition**: A right-of-use asset is recognized at the commencement of a lease.
2. **Cost Measurement**: The cost includes the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments, lease incentives, initial direct costs, and estimated costs for dismantling and site restoration, unless these are part of inventories.
3. **Depreciation**: Right-of-use assets are depreciated straight-line over the lease period or the asset’s useful life, whichever is shorter. If the entity expects to own the asset at lease end, depreciation is over the asset’s estimated useful life.
4. **Impairment and Adjustment**: Right-of-use assets can be impaired or adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.
5. **Short-Term and Low-Value Leases**: The entity does not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of 12 months or less and for low-value assets; lease payments are expensed as incurred.",rectifier
"The passage describes the recognition and measurement of lease liabilities. Here are the key points:

1. **Recognition**: A lease liability is recognized at the lease's commencement date.
   
2. **Initial Recognition**: It is initially recognized at the present value of lease payments, discounted using either the interest rate implicit in the lease or the incremental borrowing rate of the consolidated entity, if the implicit rate cannot be determined.

3. **Components of Lease Payments**: These include fixed payments, variable lease payments dependent on an index or rate, residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option, and termination penalties. Variable lease payments not dependent on an index or rate are expensed immediately.

4. **Measurement**: Lease liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

5. **Remeasurement**: The carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there are changes in future lease payments (due to a change in an index or rate), residual guarantees, lease term, certainty of a purchase option, or termination penalties.

6. **Adjustments**: Remeasurement of lease liabilities requires an adjustment to the corresponding right-of-use asset, or to profit or loss if the right-of-use asset is fully written down.",rectifier
"The passage explains that equity-settled share-based compensation benefits are given to employees through the provision of shares or options over shares in exchange for the employees' services. The cost of these transactions is evaluated at the fair value on the date they are granted, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model considers various factors such as the exercise price, the term of the option, the impact of dilution, share price at grant date, expected price volatility, expected dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, and non-vesting conditions. It does not consider any other vesting conditions.",rectifier
"This passage explains the accounting treatment for equity-settled transactions:

1. **Expenses Recognition**: The cost of such transactions is recognized as an expense in the period of vesting, which occurs at the grant date.
2. **Equity Increase**: There is a corresponding increase in equity at the vesting date.
3. **Cumulative Charge Calculation**: The charge to profit or loss is calculated using the grant date fair value of the award, an estimate of the number of awards that are likely to vest, and the expired portion of the vesting period.
4. **Reporting and Recognition**: The amount recognized in profit or loss for each period is the cumulative amount calculated up to that reporting date, minus any amounts already recognized in previous periods.
5. **Modification Impact**: If equity-settled awards are modified, the expense is recognized as if the modification did not occur. An additional expense is recognized over the remaining vesting period if the modification increases the total fair value of the share-based compensation benefit as of the modification date.",rectifier
"The passage explains two scenarios regarding equity-settled awards:

1. **Vesting Condition Failure**: 
   - If the non-vesting condition is within the control of the consolidated entity or employee and is not satisfied, it is treated as a cancellation.
   - If the condition is not within their control and is not met during the vesting period, any remaining expense is recognized over the remaining vesting period unless the award is forfeited.

2. **Cancellations and Substitution**:
   - If an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it has vested on the date of cancellation, and any remaining expense is recognized immediately.
   - If a new replacement award is substituted for the cancelled award, the two awards are treated as if they were a modification.",rectifier
"The passage indicates that the consolidated entity is divided into 4 operating segments. These segments are identified based on internal reports reviewed by the executive management committee, which is responsible for assessing performance and allocating resources. The committee considers the business from both a product and geographic perspective. The operating segments are not aggregated.
