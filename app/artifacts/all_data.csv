"Что такое специалитет? Специалитет в вузе — это одна из программ, которая готовит квалифицированных специалистов. Простыми словами — студент, выбравший этот вариант обучения, получает узкоспециальную профессию. Такую, как звукорежиссёр, клинический психолог, судмедэксперт и прочее. Срок обучения на специалитете — 5–6 лет. Первые два года студент проходит общую базовую подготовку по выбранному направлению. Следующие 3–4 года занимает расширенное изучение профессии. С дипломом специалиста можно поступить в аспирантуру. В 2025 году специалитет включает 106 специальностей, которые предусматривают около 300 зачётных единиц — практики, учебные дисциплины и итоговую аттестацию.",edu
"Какие Плюсы специалитета? Специалитет подразумевает более углублённый уровень обучения — зачётных единиц здесь почти на треть больше, чем в бакалавриате. Студенты изучают прикладные дисциплины, которые после вуза позволяют устраиваться на востребованную работу с солидной заработной платой. Например, моделирование высокотехнологичных систем или разработку промышленного оборудования.Если студент после окончания обучения хочет продолжить учёбу или заняться научно-исследовательской деятельностью, специалитет предоставляет ему выбор. В дальнейшем можно поступить в магистратуру или аспирантуру.",edu
"Какие Минусы специалитета? К минусам специалитета можно отнести более долгий срок обучения. Кроме того, возможность получить специальность есть не во всех вузах.",edu
"Что такое бакалавриат? До 2003 года выбора, как такового, у студентов не было — все учились пять лет и получали диплом специалиста. Когда Россия присоединилась к международной Болонской системе, студенты смогли получать высшее образование по ускоренной программе. Она включает в себя базовые знания по направлению обучения, которое обычно длится четыре года. Если студент стремится поднять уровень своих знаний, ему придётся ещё на два года поступить в магистратуру — главное, чтобы таковая была в выбранном вузе. Но можно продолжить обучение и в другом учебном заведении. У будущих бакалавров гораздо больший выбор в плане направлений — 187, зачётных единиц на треть меньше — около Главный плюс бакалавриата — возможность устроиться на работу и в России, и за рубежом. Иностранные работодатели охотно принимают не связанных с конкретной специальностью выпускников-бакалавров, поскольку Болонская система образования имеет широкое распространение в США и Европе. Найти работу по специальности за границей несколько сложнее — аналогов специалитета в той же Европе нет. Бакалавры могут поступить в магистратуру, в том числе на бюджет. При этом им предоставляют отсрочку от армии.",edu
"Какие минусы бакалавриата Степени бакалавра часто бывает недостаточно, если выпускник вуза собирается устроиться в бюджетную организацию или на госслужбу. В таких структурах выше ценится прикладная специальность. За границей устроиться на работу проще, однако придётся подтвердить уровень владения иностранным языком.",edu
"Отличия бакалавриата от специалитета Ключевые различия между бакалавриатом и специалитетом заключаются в продолжительности и содержании обучения. Бакалавры и специалисты получают диплом о высшем образовании. Однако на бакалавриате в документе будет указано звание «бакалавр». Тогда как на специалитете прописывают специальность, например «художник-декоратор».",edu
"Сроки поступления и вступительные испытания на бакалавриат и специалитет не отличаются — абитуриентов принимают после школы или колледжа. Равно как и дополнительные испытания вуз может предусмотреть по обеим программам. Стоимость обучения — примерно одинаковая. Однако у бакалавриата часто бывают скидки за счёт большей популярности среди абитуриентов. Скидки на специалитет — редкость. При этом можно рассчитывать на квоты по бюджетным местам — как правило, такое встречается среди врачебных специальностей.",edu
"Что изменится в системе высшего образования с сентября 2026 года? Летом 2022 года Россия вышла из Болонской системы, однако в 2025-м всё ещё вёдётся набор студентов на бакалавриат в большинстве ВУЗов. С началом нового учебного года осенью 2026 года бакалавриат и специалитет в России будут упразднены. Вместо них будет базовое высшее образование. Магистратуру заменит специализированное высшее образование, а профессиональное высшее — вместо аспирантуры. В шести крупных университетах уже вступила в силу новая система высшего образования.",edu
"Что будет с дипломами, полученным до введения базового высшего образования? Дипломы останутся полноценными и будут иметь прежнюю силу. Аналогичной была история с дипломами, которые были получены в СССР и в России до появления бакалавриата и специалитета.",edu
"Что будет с образованием студентов, поступивших в ВУЗы до введения базового высшего образования? По разъяснению Минобрнауки, учащиеся, поступившие на бакалавриат и специалитет, смогут завершить те учебные программы, на которые они поступали. Тем самым переход на новые рельсы будет плавным.",edu

"Что такое звезда Мишлен? Звезда Мишлен — одна из самых престижных наград в мире гастрономии, которая присуждается ресторанам. Этот знак отличия ассоциируется с безупречным качеством еды, высоким уровнем сервиса и профессионализма. Но звезда Мишлен — это не только награда для ресторана. Она также отражает высокий уровень профессионализма шеф-повара и его команды.",Michelin
"Как появилась звезда Мишлен? Французская компания Michelin, основанная в 1889 году братьями Андре и Эдуардом Мишлен, прославилась производством шин для автомобилей. Однако бизнес, связанный с производством шин, потребовал необычных маркетинговых решений для привлечения внимания к автотуризму, который тогда только зарождался. Чтобы стимулировать автомобилистов к путешествиям, в 1900 году компания начала выпускать красный гид Мишлен — справочник, который содержал полезную информацию для водителей, включая карты дорог, заправочные станции, гостиницы и рестораны. Спустя годы руководство Michelin заметило, что рестораны становятся все более важной частью путешествий. В 1926 году появилась первая звезда Мишлен, которая была введена для выделения ресторанов с отличной кухней. В 1931 году система была усовершенствована, и появился трехзвездочный рейтинг.",Michelin
"Сколько уровней звезд Мишлен существует? Существует три уровня: одна звезда — «очень хороший ресторан в своей категории», две звезды — «отличная кухня, ради которой стоит сделать крюк», три звезды — «исключительная кухня, ради которой стоит совершить отдельное путешествие».",Michelin
"Кто присуждает звезды Мишлен? Звезды присуждаются инспекторами Michelin Guide, которые инкогнито посещают рестораны и оценивают их по строгим критериям. Никто из сотрудников ресторана не знает о визите инспекторов, что обеспечивает объективность оценки.",Michelin
"Кто такие инспекторы Мишлен? Это профессионалы ресторанного бизнеса, работающие инкогнито. Их личности держатся в строжайшей тайне.",Michelin
"Какие критерии учитываются при присуждении звезд Мишлен? Основные критерии включают качество ингредиентов, уровень мастерства приготовления, гармонию вкусов, индивидуальность кухни и стабильность качества блюд.",Michelin
"Что дает звезда Мишлен? Получение звезды Мишлен кардинально меняет судьбу ресторана и шеф-повара. Награда привлекает новых клиентов, увеличивает узнаваемость заведения и может значительно повысить цены на блюда. Однако с этим приходит и огромная ответственность. Заведениям необходимо постоянно поддерживать высокий уровень качества, чтобы сохранить свою звезду. В противном случае ресторан может её потерять.",Michelin
"Можно ли потерять звезду Мишлен? Звезда Мишлен — это не пожизненная награда. Ресторан может лишиться ее, если не будет поддерживать высокий стандарт качества. Один из самых известных примеров — это японский суши-бар Sukiyabashi Jiro в Токио, который утратил звезду Мишлен, несмотря на мировую известность. Причина проста: заведение стало недоступным для широкой публики, и обычные посетители не могли туда попасть.",Michelin
"Обязательно ли ресторан должен быть дорогим, чтобы получить звезду Мишлен? Нет, стоимость блюд не является критерием. Даже скромные заведения могут получить звезду, если предлагают исключительную кухню.",Michelin
"Как часто проводятся проверки ресторанов для гида Мишлен? Инспекторы посещают рестораны несколько раз, чтобы убедиться, что уровень качества остается неизменно высоким. Сама система оценки остаётся тайной, а инспекторы обязаны хранить конфиденциальность.",Michelin
"Есть ли рестораны с четырьмя звездами Мишлен? Максимально возможное количество звезд — это три. Более высоких категорий в системе Мишлен не существует, и информация о «пятизвездочных ресторанах Мишлен» является мифом.",Michelin
"Какой ресторан первым получил три звезды Мишлен? Одним из первых ресторанов, получивших три звезды, стал «La Tour d’Argent» во Франции в 1933 году.",Michelin
"Влияет ли интерьер ресторана на присуждение звезды? Нет, но атмосфера и комфорт оцениваются в отдельной категории гида.",Michelin
"Может ли фастфуд-ресторан получить звезду Мишлен? Да, если он соответствует стандартам качества. Например, ресторан уличной еды в Сингапуре получил звезду Мишлен в 2016 году.",Michelin
"Какой город имеет наибольшее количество ресторанов с тремя звездами Мишлен? Токио — город с наибольшим количеством ресторанов, имеющих три звезды.",Michelin
"Есть ли звезды Мишлен в России? На 2025 год список ресторанов со звездами Мишлен в России насчитывает девять заведений. Из них семь обладают одной отметкой, два заведения – двумя.",Michelin
"Какой ресторан и когда в России получил первую звезду Michelin? Первый ресторан в России со звездой Мишлен – известное в столице место «Селфи», принадлежащий Анатолию Казакову получили награду в 2021 году.",Michelin
"Какие самые известные шеф-повара со звездами Мишлен? Ален Дюкасс: шеф-повар с 21 звездой Мишлен на разных этапах своей карьеры. Гордон Рамзи: известный британский шеф, чьи рестораны собрали 16 звезд Мишлен. Эти повара стали иконами мировой кулинарии, их рестораны входят в списки лучших заведений на планете.",Michelin
"Какие страны с наибольшим количеством звезд Мишлен? Франция: родина награды, здесь сосредоточено более 30 ресторанов с тремя звездами. Япония: страна высококлассной кухни, в которой находятся десятки ресторанов с высшими оценками. Италия, Испания, США: эти страны тоже могут похвастаться множеством заведений с двумя и тремя звездами Мишлен.",Michelin
"Что такое потребительская корзина? В 1992 году в России впервые составили перечень продуктов питания, промышленных товаров и услуг, необходимых человеку для удовлетворения базовых потребностей. Позже его назвали потребительской корзиной, а в 1999 году закрепили это понятие в законе. С тех пор ПК служит своеобразным ориентиром, к которым государство соотносит доходы населения, льготы и социальные выплаты. ПК помогает вести статистику в масштабах страны: сколько население должно потреблять и каковы реальные объёмы потребления.",potr_carz
"Как рассчитывается потребительская корзина? ПК формируют отдельно для детей, трудоспособного населения и пенсионеров. Росстат собирает и обрабатывает информацию о фактических основных расходах (на еду, коммуналку, лекарства и т. п.) в малоимущих семьях. Затем эту информацию соотносят с рекомендациями учёных по минимальным потребностям человека. А ещё наполнение корзины зависит от ситуации в экономике страны и возможностей бюджета.",potr_carz
"Как составляется список продуктов потребительской корзины? Составляя список продовольственных и непродовольственных товаров, учитывают следующие факторы -состав и энергетическую ценность продуктов питания; климатические условия разных территорий России;национальные традиции и местные особенности питания в регионах. Территория РФ поделена на десять зон, и в каждой из них своя потребительская корзина. К примеру, на севере страны выше потребление жиров, поскольку на холоде нужно больше энергоёмкой пищи. В приморских регионах едят больше рыбы, на юге — овощей и фруктов. В мусульманских регионах в мясной группе продуктов преобладает говядина и баранина, и почти нет свинины. Есть разница и в наполнении корзины непродовольственными товарами и услугами (покупка одежды и обуви, оплата коммунальных услуг и т.п.). В холодных климатических зонах их потребление на 15–20 % выше, чем в регионах с тёплым и умеренным климатом.",potr_carz
Чему равна стоимость потребительской корзины? С 1999 по 2021 год стоимость ПК была чуть меньше прожиточного минимума. Сейчас минимальная потребительская корзина официально не рассчитывается. И только по традиции её приравнивают к прожиточному минимуму. В 2025 году его размер составляет 17 733 рубля на человека (средний месячный показатель по стране на душу населения).,potr_carz
"Что входит в состав потребительской корзины? Потребительская корзина в РФ состоит из трёх компонентов.Первый - Продукты питания — 50 % от общей стоимости. второй - Непродовольственные товары —25 %. Третий - Услуги — 25 %. Продуктовая часть корзины — более тридцати наименований продуктов, объединённых в одиннадцать групп. Это хлебобулочные и мучные изделия, крупы, картофель, несколько основных видов овощей и фруктов, мясо, рыба, яйца, молочные продукты, сахар, растительные жиры и пр. Продукция посчитана в килограммах на год на одного человека. Пользуясь этими цифрами, можно посчитать, сколько чего нужно на месяц, рассчитать дневную норму потребления. Непродовольственная группа включает одежду, обувь, бельё, постельные принадлежности, хозтовары, лекарства и другие предметы первой необходимости. Они рассчитаны в штуках с учётом времени износа. В разделе услуг заложены расходы на оплату жилья, коммуналку (вода, электричество, газ, отопление), транспорт и пр. Каждые пять лет продуктовую корзину пересматривают. Это происходит не только потому, что растут цены. Меняется и её наполнение. По сравнению с 1999 годом в наборе жизненно необходимых товаров стало меньше растительных жиров и маргарина, хлеба, мучных изделий, картофеля, зато выросли нормы для молочных продуктов, фруктов и овощей, мяса, рыбы, яиц.",potr_carz

"How are you going to make money out of this? We believe in fast and secure messaging that is also 100% free. Our founder and CEO Pavel Durov, who financed Telegram throughout most of its history, has outlined a strategy to make Telegram sustainable in this post. Following this plan, Telegram has implemented sustainable forms of monetization that prioritize its users: In 2021, Telegram launched Sponsored Messages – minimalist, privacy-conscious advertisements that can appear in certain public channels. In 2022, Telegram launched a Premium subscription which users can purchase to both support the app and unlock additional exclusive features. These revenue streams help us pay for infrastructure costs and developer salaries, however making profits will never be an end-goal for Telegram.",telegram
"What are you thoughts on internet privacy? We think that the two most important components of Internet privacy should be: protecting your private conversations from snooping third parties, such as officials, employers, etc. and protecting your personal data from third parties, such as marketers, advertisers, etc. Telegram's aim is to create a truly free messenger, with a revolutionary privacy policy.",telegram
"There's illegal content on Telegram. How do I take it down? All Telegram apps have 'Report' buttons that let you flag illegal content for our moderators — in just a few taps. On Telegram for Android, tap the message and select Report from the menu. On iOS, press and hold the message. On Telegram Desktop, Web or Telegram for macOS, right-click the message and select Report. Then choose an appropriate reason.",telegram
"How do I send a request under EU Regulation 2021-784? The Regulation (EU) 2021-784 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2021 on addressing the dissemination of terrorist content online (Terrorist Content Online Regulation, or TCO Regulation) allows authorities in EU countries to send removal requests for terrorist content, if it is discovered on Telegram's public platform. We have also designated a third party, European Digital Services Representative (EDSR), to assist us with TCO-related communications. Users whose publications were taken down in connection with the TCO Regulation can request details on why their publications were considered terrorist and how to challenge the removal by contacting the EUregulation bot on Telegram.",telegram
"A bot or channel is infringing on my copyright. What do I do? Private groups and chats on Telegram are private amongst their participants. We do not process any requests related to them. However, Telegram also supports sticker sets, bots, channels and groups that are publicly available. If you see a bot, channel, sticker set, or other content that is a part of Telegram’s public platform and is infringing on your copyright, kindly submit a complaint to dmca@telegram.org. Please note that such requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.",telegram
"Do you process take-down requests from third parties? Our mission is to provide a secure means of communication that works everywhere on the planet. To do this in the places where it is most needed (and to continue distributing Telegram through the App Store and Google Play), we have to process legitimate requests to take down illegal public content (e.g., sticker sets, bots, groups and channels) within the app. For example, we can take down sticker sets that violate intellectual property rights or porn bots. Public content on Telegram, such as user-uploaded stickers sets, channels, and bots by third-party developers, is not part of the core Telegram UI. Whenever we receive a report regarding potentially illegal public content, we perform the necessary legal checks and take it down when deemed appropriate. Please note that this does not apply to local restrictions on freedom of speech. For example, if criticizing the government is illegal in some country, Telegram won't be a part of such politically motivated censorship. This goes against our founders' principles. While we do block terrorist (e.g. ISIS-related) bots and channels, we will not block anybody who peacefully expresses alternative opinions.",telegram
"My bot or sticker set was banned unfairly, what do I do? If you think we banned your bot, channel, or sticker set for no apparent reasons, drop us a line at abuse@telegram.org.",telegram
"Do you process data requests? Secret chats use end-to-end encryption, thanks to which we don't have any data to disclose. To protect the data that is not covered by end-to-end encryption, Telegram uses a distributed infrastructure. Cloud chat data is stored in multiple data centers around the globe that are controlled by different legal entities spread across different jurisdictions. The relevant decryption keys are split into parts and are never kept in the same place as the data they protect. As a result, several court orders from different jurisdictions are required to force us to give up any data. Thanks to this structure, we can ensure that no single government or block of like-minded countries can intrude on people's privacy and freedom of expression. Telegram can be forced to give up data only if an issue is grave and universal enough to pass the scrutiny of several different legal systems around the world. To this day, we have disclosed 0 bytes of user messages to third parties, including governments.",telegram
Who can I write to? You can write to people who are in your phone contacts and have Telegram. Another way of contacting people is to type their Telegram username into the search field – you don't need to know their phone number to do this.,telegram
"Who can contact me? People can contact you on Telegram if they know your phone number or if you message them first. If they don't know your phone number, they can find you if you both are members of the same group or if you set a public username. Others can use Global Search and find you by your public username.",telegram
"Does Telegram send Verification Codes for other apps? Telegram allows third-party services to send verification codes to their users via Telegram. These codes only appear in the verified Verification Codes chat, and let you tap to instantly copy the code.If you receive a code in the Verification Codes chat, it's probably because you requested to log in to a third-party service, like an external website, app or marketplace. It's also possible that someone else accidentally entered your phone number when logging in to another service. Either way, your Telegram account is completely safe — if you didn’t request a code, simply tap on it and select Report buttom, no need to do anything else. Third-party services determine which way your verification codes are sent – and Telegram is not able to control this or make a service aware of your preferences. Unlike SMS codes that frequently fail to arrive and can be interecepted, verification codes sent via Telegram are delivered instantly and are securely encrypted – making them safer and more reliable for both users and services. The Verification Codes chat is only used for codes from third-party services. Login codes for your Telegram account itself are sent to the verified service notifications chat named Telegram in your chat list and should never be shared with anyone, including other services or apps.",telegram
"How do I know who in my contacts has Telegram? Your contacts, who have Telegram, are shown at the top of your Contacts. They also have pictures.",telegram
"How do I invite my friends? iOS: The basic invitations are simple SMS messages. They will be charged as standard outgoing SMS by your carrier (unless sent via iMessage). Naturally, you have other options to bring your friends here. Try sending them a download link via any other messaging service: email, Facebook, WhatsApp, an actual telegram — you name it. Android: Open the app menu (swipe right in chat list) and then click Invite Friends. Then choose an application via which you would like to send out invitations.",telegram
What do the check marks mean? One check — message delivered to the Telegram cloud and your friend has been notified if he allows notifications. Two checks — message read (your friend opened Telegram and opened the conversation with the message). We don't have a delivered to device status for messages because Telegram can run on as many devices as you want. So which particular one would that check mean?,telegram
"Can I hide my last seen time? You can choose who sees this info in Privacy and Security settings. Remember that you won't see Last Seen timestamps for people with whom you don't share your own. You will, however, see an approximate last seen value. This keeps stalkers away but makes it possible to understand whether a person is reachable over Telegram.",telegram
"Can I delete my messages? Yes. You can always delete any messages you sent or received for both sides in any one-on-one conversation (in groups, it's still your own messages only). You can also clear the entire chat history on both ends. On Telegram, deleted messages do not leave a mark in the chat.Together with privacy settings for forwarded messages, this makes exchanging Telegram messages similar to talking face to face (without a tape recorder). As a result, users no longer need to worry about the data accumulating in their chats over the years. Both parties in a conversation have full control over what does and what doesn't belong to their online identity.",telegram
"Can I make calls via Telegram? Yes! You can make end-to-end encrypted Voice Calls and Video Calls. If you want more participants, try starting a Voice Chat in one of the groups you created. Voice Chats add a live layer of ephemeral talk to the group. They can be used as virtual office spaces for teams or informal lounges for any community. While Voice Chats are not group calls, they can achieve similar goals.",telegram
"How can I use emoticons? Type one word in your input field to get relevant emoji suggestions. You can also type “:” followed by any keyword to open emoji search – like :heart. You can suggest missing keywords for emoji in your language using this interface (this will open suggestions for English, don't forget to change to your language in the left menu).",telegram
"What's the difference between groups and channels? Telegram groups are ideal for sharing stuff with friends and family or collaboration in small teams. But groups can also grow very large and support communities of up to 200,000 members. You can make any group public, toggle persistent history to control whether or not new members have access to earlier messages and appoint administrators with granular privileges. You can also pin important messages to the top of the screen so that all members can see them, including those who have just joined. Channels are a tool for broadcasting messages to large audiences. In fact, a channel can have an unlimited number of subscribers. When you post in a channel, the message is signed with the channel's name and photo and not your own. Each message in a channel has a view counter that gets updated when the message is viewed, including its forwarded copies.",telegram
"How do I create a group? IOS: Start a new message and then click on ""New Group"". Android: Tap the circular pencil icon in the chat list and then click on ""New Group"". Telegram Desktop: click the menu button in the top left corner and then click on ""New Group"".",telegram
"What are usernames? How do I get one? You can set a public username on Telegram. It then becomes possible for other users to find you by that username – you will appear in search under global results. Please note that people who find you will be able to send you messages, even if they don't know your number. If you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting a username on Telegram. You can set up a username in Settings and use the universal search box in the chat list to search for chats, messages, and usernames.",telegram
"What are Collectible Usernames? How are they different from basic usernames? Collectible usernames work just like basic usernames, they appear in Global Search results and have their own links that can be used outside of Telegram: username.t.me. They can be bought and sold through third-party platforms like Fragment, giving a simple and secure way to acquire and exchange valuable Telegram domains. Acquiring a collectible username gives permanent ownership, verified by the TON blockchain. Owners of collectible usernames can freely assign them to chats, sell them to others, or keep them for later use.",telegram
"What can I use as my username? You can use a-z, 0-9 and underscores. Usernames are case-insensitive, but Telegram will store your capitalization preferences (e.g. Telegram and TeleGram is the same user).",telegram
"Do I need a username? You don't have to get one. Remember that Telegram usernames are public and choosing a username on Telegram makes it possible for people to find you in global search and send you messages even if they don't have your number. If you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting up a username.",telegram
"If someone finds me by username, messages and I reply — will they know my number? No. Neither party will see another's phone number (unless this is permitted by your privacy settings). This is similar to the case when you message a person who you've met in a Telegram group.",telegram
How do I delete my username? Go to Settings and save an empty username. This will remove your username; people will no longer be able to find you via search. This will not affect existing conversations.,telegram
"How secure is Telegram? Telegram is more secure than mass market messengers like WhatsApp and Line. We are based on the MTProto protocol, built upon time-tested algorithms to make security compatible with high-speed delivery and reliability on weak connections. We are continuously working with the community to improve the security of our protocol and clients.",telegram
"What if I’m more paranoid than your regular user? We've got you covered. Telegram’s special secret chats use end-to-end encryption, leave no trace on our servers, support self-destructing messages and don’t allow forwarding. On top of this, secret chats are not part of the Telegram cloud and can only be accessed on their devices of origin.",telegram
"So how do you encrypt data? We support two layers of secure encryption. Server-client encryption is used in Cloud Chats (private and group chats), Secret Chats use an additional layer of client-client encryption. All data, regardless of type, is encrypted in the same way be it text, media or files. Our encryption is based on 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. You can find more info in the Advanced FAQ.",telegram
"Why should I trust you? Telegram is open, anyone can check our source code, protocol and API, see how everything works and make an informed decision. Telegram supports verifiable builds, which allow experts to independently verify that our code published on GitHub is the exact same code that is used to build the apps you download from App Store or Google Play. We welcome security experts to audit our system and appreciate any feedback at security@telegram.org. On top of that, Telegram's primary focus is not to bring a profit, so commercial interests will never interfere with our mission.",telegram
"Do I need to trust Telegram for this to be secure? When it comes to secret chats, you don't — just make sure that the visualized key of your secret chat matches the one in your friend's secret chat settings.",telegram
"What if my hacker friend says they could decipher Telegram messages? Anyone who claims that Telegram messages can be deciphered is welcome to prove that claim in our competition and win $300,You can check out the Cracking Contest Description to learn more. Any comments on Telegram's security are welcome at security@telegram.org. All submissions which result in a change of code or configuration are eligible for bounties, ranging from $100 to $100,000 or more, depending on the severity of the issue. Please note that we can not offer bounties for issues that are disclosed to the public before they are fixed.",telegram
"Why can jailbroken and rooted devices be dangerous? Using a rooted or jailbroken device makes it easier for a potential attacker to gain full administrative control over your device — root access. A user with root access can easily bypass security features built into the operating system, read process memory or access restricted areas, such as the internal storage. Once an attacker has root access, any efforts to mitigate threats become futile. No application can be called safe under these circumstances, no matter how strong the encryption.",telegram
"How are secret chats different? Secret chats are meant for people who want more secrecy than the average fella. All messages in secret chats use end-to-end encryption. This means only you and the recipient can read those messages — nobody else can decipher them, including us here at Telegram (more on this here). On top of this, Messages cannot be forwarded from secret chats. And when you delete messages on your side of the conversation, the app on the other side of the secret chat will be ordered to delete them as well. You can order your messages, photos, videos and files to self-destruct in a set amount of time after they have been read or opened by the recipient. The message will then disappear from both your and your friend's devices. All secret chats in Telegram are device-specific and are not part of the Telegram cloud. This means you can only access messages in a secret chat from their device of origin. They are safe for as long as your device is safe in your pocket.",telegram
"How do I start a secret chat? Open the profile of the user you want to contact. Tap on ‘…’, then ‘Start Secret Chat’. Remember that Telegram secret chats are device-specific. If you start a secret chat with a friend on one of your devices, this chat will only be available on that device. If you log out, you will lose all your secret chats. You can create as many different secret chats with the same contact as you like.",telegram
"How do self-destructing messages work? The Self-Destruct Timer is available for all messages in Secret Chats and for media in private cloud chats. To set the timer, simply tap the clock icon (in the input field on iOS, top bar on Android), and then choose the desired time limit. The clock starts ticking the moment the message is displayed on the recipient's screen (gets two check marks). As soon as the time runs out, the message disappears from both devices. We will try to send a notification if a screenshot is taken. Please note that the timer in Secret Chats only applies to messages that were sent after the timer was set. It has no effect on earlier messages.",telegram
"Can I be certain that my conversation partner doesn't take a screenshot? Unfortunately, there is no bulletproof way of detecting screenshots on certain systems (most notably, some Android and Windows Phone devices). We will make every effort to alert you about screenshots taken in your Secret Chats, but it may still be possible to bypass such notifications and take screenshots silently. We advise to share sensitive information only with people you trust. After all, nobody can stop a person from taking a picture of their screen with a different device or an old school camera.",telegram
"What is this Encryption Key thing? When a secret chat is created, the participating devices exchange encryption keys using the so-called Diffie-Hellman key exchange. After the secure end-to-end connection has been established, we generate a picture that visualizes the encryption key for your chat. You can then compare this image with the one your friend has — if the two images are the same, you can be sure that the secret chat is secure, and no man-in-the-middle attack can succeed. Newer versions of Telegram apps will show a larger picture along with a textual representation of the key (this is not the key itself, of course!) when both participants are using an updated app. Always compare visualizations using a channel that is known to be secure — it's safest if you do this in person, in an offline meeting with the conversation partner.",telegram
"How do I change my phone number? You can change your number in Telegram and keep everything, including all your contacts, messages, and media from the Telegram cloud, as well as all your Secret Chats on all devices. To change your number, go to Settings, then tap on your phone number (just above the username), then click Change Number. If you already have a different Telegram account on the target number, you'll need to delete that account first.",telegram
"How do I delete my account? If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page. Deleting your account permanently removes all your messages and contacts. All groups and channels that you've created are orphaned and left without a creator but admins retain their rights. This action must be confirmed via your Telegram account and cannot be undone.",telegram
"What happens if I delete my account? As was just mentioned above, all your data will be flushed from our system: all messages, groups, and contacts associated with your account will be deleted. That said, your contacts will still be able to chat in the groups that you have created, and they will still have their copy of the messages you sent them. So if you want to send messages that can vanish without a trace, try using our self-destruct timer instead. Termination of a Telegram account is irreversible. If you sign up again, you will appear as a new user and will not get your history, contacts or groups back. People, who have your phone number in their contacts, will be notified. The new user will be displayed as a separate conversation in their messages list and their conversation history with this new user will be empty.",telegram
"How does account self-destruction work? Telegram is not a commercial organization, and we value our disk space greatly. If you stop using Telegram and don't come online for at least 18 months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media, contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud. You can change the exact period after which your inactive account will self-destruct in Settings.",telegram
What are bots? Bots are like small programs that run right inside Telegram. They are made by third-party developers using the Telegram Bot API.,telegram
"How do I create a bot? Creating Telegram bots is super-easy, but you will need at least some skills in computer programming. If you're sure you're up to it, our Introduction for Developers is a good place to start. Unfortunately, there are no out-of-the-box ways to create a working bot if you are not a developer. But we're sure you'll soon find plenty of bots created by other people to play with.",telegram
"A bot is sending me messages, how do I make it stop? If you don't want a bot to send you messages, feel free to block it – same as you would block a human user. Some Telegram clients have a Stop Bot button right in the bot's profile. That said, most bot developers offer commands that silence the bot, check its  in help for clues.",telegram
"Where can I find more bots? There is no official store at the moment, so you'll have to ask your friends or search the web for now. We're pretty sure you'll find some bots to play with.",telegram

Наши клубы открывались в разные периоды, поэтому в клубах действуют разные типы пропусков: браслет/пластиковая клубная карта/электронная клубная карта. Браслет – универсальный пропуск для прохода через турникеты, открытия\закрытия шкафчика в раздевалке, в некоторых клубах для въезда на парковку. В большинстве наших клубов вы получите браслет. Пластиковая клубная карта при каждом визите обменивается на рецепции клуба на механический ключ от шкафчика в раздевалке. Пластиковой картой невозможно открыть электронный замок в раздевалке, но в некоторых клубах этот вариант более удобен для въезда на парковку. Электронная клубная карта доступна в личном кабинете для всех членов клуба. При предъявлении на стойке сервисной службы вы так же получаете механический ключ от шкафчика в раздевалке. Условия парковки уточняйте на стойке сервисной службы вашего клуба.",world_class

"""We operate from trend to spend for our customers"" 
Brave Bison competes in a growing and exciting marketplace at the intersection of social media, technology, data science and ecommerce. 
We operate from trend to spend for our customers; promoting products, selling advertising on our channels and building transactional websites and apps to enable check out. Our vision is to build a company for the new era and the past twelve months have seen us consolidate and integrate across what has become our foundational platform. 
Brave Bison operates across four business pillars: 
Brave Bison Performance is a digital media advertising practice. We plan and buy media on platforms such as Google, Meta, TikTok, Amazon and YouTube. All of our work is focused on helping our customers drive conversion metrics such sales, downloads and subscriptions. Customers include New Balance, Curry's and Asus.",brave
"Brave Bison Commerce is a digital commerce practice. We provide technology services to help customers design and build next generation ecommerce platforms. Our teams use the latest MACH technology from partners such as Salesforce, Adobe, SAP and BigCommerce to design, launch, upgrade and support best-in-class ecommerce systems. Customers include Viking Direct, MKM Building Supplies and Muller. 
Brave Bison Social & Influencer (re-branded to Social Chain as of February 2023) is a social media advertising practice. We create content for customers on social media platforms and work with influencers to make and distribute content. This creative approach ensures that content is native to the platform, leading to higher engagements from audiences. Customers include Panasonic, Vodafone, WWF and Rapyd.",brave
"Brave Bison Media Network is a portfolio of channels across YouTube, Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok and Instagram. These channels generate over 1 billion monthly views, and the advertising inventory from each channel is sold through online advertising exchanges. Popular channels include The Hook, PGA Tour, US Open and Link Up TV. 
Whilst each of our business pillars is led by a Managing Director and supported by department heads, the Brave Bison platform is one of connection and collaboration. We have worked hard over the past year to ensure that, despite our four centres of excellence, we operate as one company, with a shared vision that aligns across each of our business pillars. 
 Year in Review",brave
"Year in Review 
2022 was a strong year for Brave Bison. During the period revenue grew by 46% to almost ВЈ32m, gross profit more than doubled to just under ВЈ17m and the company generated adjusted EBITDA of over ВЈ3m, a YoY increase of 71%. At year end our balance sheet remained strong with net cash of over ВЈ6m, after having completed our third acquisition since Theo, Philippa and I joined the company mid 2020. 
During the period the Leadership Team maintained a sharp operational focus. We completed the integration of four businesses, made our third acquisition, and relaunched an enhanced value and service proposition under a refreshed Brave Bison brand. This integrated and connected approach has already proven its ability to attract new customers and allow for effective cross selling across our four business units.",brave
"Best Response Media (BRM) was acquired during the period and integrated into Brave Bison Commerce. Until the acquisition, our efforts at Brave Bison Commerce were focused on three major enterprise ecommerce platforms: SAP, Salesforce and BigCommerce. Through the acquisition of BRM, we are now able to offer services on Adobe Commerce Cloud, a ubiquitous platform that has grown from strength-to-strength in recent years. Furthermore, we acquired a highly experienced and flexible resource base in Mansoura, Egypt, as well as Tier 1 customers including NatWest.",brave
"Brave Bison is headquartered in London, but the business operates across the world. We have staff in 11 countries and almost a quarter of our team works remotely. Furthermore, over 50% of our staff work on a hybrid basis, often choosing to come into the office between one and three days per week. This new way of working is an important part of our strategy moving forward and is telling of the digital age we are leaning into as a business. Our hybrid and remote workforce enables us to hire more quickly, cheaply and often from a more diverse pool of talent. This approach also means that, as we scale and grow our teams, we can keep property costs low whilst maintaining a strong culture through a mixture of virtual team events and quarterly in person socials.",brave
"Theo and I are committed to developing Brave Bison's board in a thoughtful and measured way, in line with modern standards of governance. The appointment of Gordon Brough as non-executive director during the period is a further indication of this commitment. Gordon has extensive experience in UK public companies having been General Counsel at Aberdeen Asset Management plc (subsequently the asset management arm of Abrdn) for almost 10 years. Gordon's legal experience, as well as his expertise in acquisitions will be crucial to the business as we look to further bolster our corporate profile. 
 Outlook 
We are mindful of macroeconomic challenges over the next 12-18 months, but have confidence in the prevailing trend that continues to shift marketing budgets away from traditional advertising and into digital channels. Furthermore, our position in this expanding marketplace is differentiated and growing from strength-to-strength.",brave
"This organic growth will be compounded by our carefully considered Acquisition & Integration strategy that has proven successful to date. Our Leadership Team is both capable and focussed, and we anticipate that the acquisition of Social Chain (completed in February 2023) will have a transformative impact on our ability to win and deliver for customers in the social media advertising space.

"""2022 was a year of healthy growth at Brave Bison"" 
2022 was a year of healthy growth at Brave Bison. Revenue increased by 46% to ВЈ31.7 million (2021: ВЈ21.7 million), gross profit increased by 117% to ВЈ16.9 million (2021: ВЈ7.8 million) and adjusted profit before tax, a measure of underlying profitability, increased by 86% to ВЈ2.6 million (2021: ВЈ1.4 million). 
Organic growth of gross profit, removing the impact of businesses acquired during the period, was ВЈ1.8 million, or approximately 12%.

"Organic growth of gross profit, removing the impact of businesses acquired during the period, was ВЈ1.8 million, or approximately 12%. 
 Principal Activities 
Brave Bison has two business models. 
Firstly, the provision of digital advertising and technology services to global blue-chip companies. Services provided include social media advertising, influencer marketing, paid media services, search engine optimisation services, ecommerce software integration, ecommerce system design and others. Customers include New Balance, Muller, Primark and Asus. This operation is referred to as ""fee based services"" in the Group segmental reporting.",brave
"The digital advertising and technology services business unit showed good growth during the year. Revenues increased by 169% to ВЈ19.7 million (2021: ВЈ7.3 million) and the gross profit approximately tripled to ВЈ14.0 million (2021: ВЈ4.8 million). In line with our acquisition and integration strategy, Greenlight Digital was integrated into Brave Bison Performance, and Greenlight Commerce and Best Response Media were integrated into Brave Bison Commerce. 
Secondly, Brave Bison owns and operates a network of social and digital media channels. These channels principally exist on platforms such as YouTube, Snapchat, Facebook, TikTok and Instagram. Brave Bison publishes content on these channels which attract views and serve advertising which can be bought programmatically through digital advertising platforms. This operation is referred to as ""advertising"" in Group segmental reporting.",brave
"The advertising business unit generated revenue of ВЈ11.9 million (2021: ВЈ14.3 million) and approximately 1.3 billion views (2021: 1.7 billion). This decrease year-on-year largely relates to channels that are operated but not owned by Brave Bison on a revenue share basis, therefore the underlying gross profit remained broadly flat at ВЈ2.9 million (2021: ВЈ3.0 million). The small drop in gross profit was largely due to a softening of CPMs (cost per mille) in the second half of the year in response to macroeconomic conditions. As we saw during the pandemic, this part of our business can be sensitive to such conditions, but tends to recover swiftly. 
 Margins & Operations 
Brave Bison tracks adjusted profit margin (adjusted profit before tax as a percentage of gross profit) as a key performance indicator to measure the Group's financial performance.",brave
"Margins & Operations 
Brave Bison tracks adjusted profit margin (adjusted profit before tax as a percentage of gross profit) as a key performance indicator to measure the Group's financial performance. 
The adjusted profit margin for the period was 15.4% (2021: 17.9%) a decrease year-on-year. This decrease was driven by the tripling of digital advertising and technology services net revenues which operates at a lower adjusted profit margin than advertising generated on the media network. 
Despite the decrease in adjusted profit margin, Brave Bison has completed a number of initiatives to reduce the underlying operating costs of the business. These include a reduction in property costs through sub-letting excess office space, reduction in IT costs as business units are merged and careful resource management to reduce the staff cost to net revenue ratio for billable customers. 
 Exceptional Costs & Adjustments",brave
"Exceptional Costs & Adjustments 
During the year Brave Bison incurred restructuring costs of ВЈ0.1 million (2021:ВЈ0.2 million), relating to the restructuring and expansion of the Group's operations in Bulgaria, and acquisition costs of ВЈ0.1 million (2021: ВЈ0.7 million) relating to the costs associated with acquiring Best Response Media.",brave
"Brave Bison carried out a purchase price allocation exercise during the year in relation to the Greenlight acquisitions which completed in 2021, which resulted in identification of intangible assets relating to the acquired brands and customer relationships. As a result of the rebranding, and retirement of the Greenlight trade brand during the year, the amounts relating to this were impaired in full during the year, resulting in an impairment charge of ВЈ0.5 million (2021: ВЈnil). The customer relationships are being amortised over a period of 10 years, resulting in a charge of ВЈ0.2 million (2021: ВЈnil). As we deliver on our acquisition and integration strategy it is likely that both the amortisation of acquired intangibles, and impairment of acquired brands retired post-integration will continue to impact our financial statements.",brave
"Equity settled share-based payments relate to the value of share awards that have been granted to employees of the Group. ВЈ0.3 million of this amount relates to the directors' LTIP, which can only be redeemed in accordance with the terms outlined in the Directors' Remuneration Report. The earliest possible redemption date is December 2024, and redemption is contingent on the share price exceeding 3.0 pence. 
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure that the Group uses to measure its performance and is defined as earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation and after add back of costs related to restructuring, acquisitions and share based payments. It should be noted that a portion of the property costs in both 2022 and 2021 fall into the finance costs and depreciation lines as a result of the introduction of IFRS 16 'Leases'.",brave
"As a result, the Group also uses Adjusted profit before tax as a measure of performance, which is stated after add back of costs related to restructuring, acquisitions, share based payments, impairments and amortisation of acquired intangibles, but which is after the deduction of costs associated with property leases.

"""Governance is central to the effective delivery of our mission and strategy"" 
 ENVIRONMENTAL 
As a digital media, digital advertising and technology services group, the direct and indirect impact of the Group on the environment is low. Nevertheless, we continue to aim to reduce our environmental impact. 
Our sustainability strategy has 3 pillars, emissions, waste & recycling and consumables. 
 Carbon emissions: 
As a service business our energy use is by far our biggest contributor to our carbon emissions. Combined, electricity and gas represent around 70% of emissions in a normal (non-pandemic) year. We encourage energy saving with simple but effective office measures.",brave
"Carbon emissions: 
As a service business our energy use is by far our biggest contributor to our carbon emissions. Combined, electricity and gas represent around 70% of emissions in a normal (non-pandemic) year. We encourage energy saving with simple but effective office measures. 
The most important of these is our pledge to offset actual carbon emissions or the highest year of emissions вЂ“ providing a direct incentive to staff to save energy, since any reduction below our worst year translates into the business being carbon negative. This is critical and, we believe, unique, as it removes the implicit ""permission to emit"" that carbon offsetting programmes can otherwise create.",brave
"Carbon Emissions are classified as Scope 1, 2 or 3. Scope 1 includes direct emissions from burning fossil fuels, Scope 2 is made up of indirect emissions that a company is directly responsible for, such as burning fossil fuels for electricity and emissions from public transport made on company business, and Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions that the company is indirectly responsible for. Scope 3 is wide and includes emissions from cloud computing, emissions associated with the manufacture of office equipment and much more.",brave
"Our Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions are measured in the first half of each year for the prior year. We partner with specialist consultants Carbon Footprint Ltd to assess and verify our footprint. The assessment includes rigorous estimates of the impact of our people working from home, which they now do a significant proportion of the time. From this year we intend our reports will cover the entirety of Scope 3 emissions, making 2022 the first year a complete and unflinching benchmark of our Carbon Footprint has been made. 
Our offsetting programme is a blend of avoided deforestation (REDD) in the Amazon, reforesting in Africa, UK tree planting, and clean cooking technology in rural China and India (where wood and coal burning is otherwise prevalent). Finally, we plant 15 trees for every new client win or renewed client contract in our Tree Nation forest.",brave
"As our measurement to date has been for Scopes 1, 2 and part of Scope 3, we only claim Scope 1 & 2 carbon neutrality (or carbon negativity in years where our offsetting is greater than our emissions). Following 2022's Carbon Footprint assessment which we expect to be complete by the end of May, it's our ambition to make a Net Zero commitment in line with the Science Based Targets Initiative, accompanied by a plan to reach Net Zero across all scopes. 
Other measures include automatic timers on our TV's and communication with our staff about the impact their energy use has. Travel was significantly reduced as a result of COVID-19, and the Group continues to minimise travel where possible. 
 Waste & Recycling",brave
"Other measures include automatic timers on our TV's and communication with our staff about the impact their energy use has. Travel was significantly reduced as a result of COVID-19, and the Group continues to minimise travel where possible. 
 Waste & Recycling 
The Group operates a largely paperless office. All employees are advised that documents and emails should not be printed, instead accessed via shared digital drives. When required, printers are set to double-sided and black and white, the aim being to reduce the use of both paper and toner.

We have an ongoing programme designed to minimise the environmental impact of our consumption beyond greenhouse gases and recycling. 
Livestock farming generates a significant percentage of global greenhouse gas emissions, with red meat and dairy producing the majority of this. A third of the water used for farming goes toward rearing farm animals. Soy and oat milk alternatives are provided, again reducing our dairy farming impact while avoiding water intensive almond milk. From this year, our ambition is to stop the routine purchase of any meat in food bought for staff and clients, with exceptions only for special events and requests.

The Board reviews the effectiveness of its performance and that of its committees and individual Directors and is satisfied that, between the Directors, it has an effective and appropriate balance of skills and knowledge, including a range of financial, commercial, sector specific, public market and entrepreneurial experience. 
The Board is also satisfied that it has a suitable balance between independence (of character and judgement) and knowledge of the Group to enable it to discharge its duties and responsibilities effectively. Matthew Law and Gordon Brough are considered to be independent. No single Director is dominant in the decision-making process.",brave

Meanwhile there are sufficient compliance structures within the Company to ensure that the governance functions that would be part of an independent Chairman's responsibility are met.

Although the Directors' defence costs may be met, neither the Company's indemnity nor the insurance policy provides cover in the event that the Director is proved to have acted dishonestly or fraudulently. No claims have been made under the indemnity or against the policy. 
 Going Concern",brave
"Going Concern 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis on the assumption that the Group continues in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
The Directors have prepared detailed cash flow projections for at least twelve months from the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements, which are based on their current expectations of trading prospects, and accordingly the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these consolidated financial statements. Further information is provided in Note 2.1 of these consolidated financial statements.

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
 An overview of the scope of our audit",brave
"An overview of the scope of our audit 
Our audit approach was a risk-based approach founded on a thorough understanding of the group's business, its environment and risk profile. We conducted substantive audit procedures and evaluated the group's internal control environment. We also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls including assessing whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that may have represented a risk of material misstatement. The components of the group were evaluated by the group audit team based on a measure of materiality, considering each component as a percentage of the group's total assets, current assets, revenue and gross profit, which allowed the group audit team to assess the significance of each component and determine the planned audit response.",brave
"For those components that were evaluated as significant components, either a full scope or specified audit approach was determined based on their relative materiality to the group and our assessment of the audit risk. For significant components requiring a full scope approach, we evaluated controls by performing walkthroughs over the financial reporting systems identified as part of our risk assessment, reviewed the accounts production process and addressed critical accounting matters. We then undertook substantive testing on significant transactions and material account balances.",brave
"In order to address the audit risks identified during our planning procedures, we performed a full scope audit of the financial statements of the parent company and of the financial information of Brave Bison Limited and Greenlight Digital Limited. We performed specified audit procedures over the other components in the UK, including Greenlight Commerce Limited, Best Response Media Limited and the Singapore and dormant entities. 
 Key audit matters",brave
"Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

"Key Audit Matter - Group How the matter was addressed in the audit - Group 
 INCORRECT REVENUE RECOGNITION 
Revenue is a significant item in the consolidated income statement and impacts a number of management's key judgements, performance indicators and key strategic indicators. 
There is a risk of incorrect revenue recognition due to fraud or error, arising from: 
- recognition of revenue in the wrong period;
- revenue not being recognised in accordance with IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers'; and
- manipulation of revenues around the year-end through management override. 
We therefore identified incorrect revenue recognition as a significant risk. 
Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: 
- Evaluating the group's revenue recognition accounting policy to check compliance with IFRS 15, which included assessing the treatment of each revenue stream under the principal versus agent criteria to test appropriate gross versus net presentation.",brave

- Performing substantive testing on a sample of individual revenue transactions throughout the year across the significant revenue streams to evaluate whether revenue is recognised in accordance with the contract terms, having considered the principles of IFRS 15 and the commercial substance of the contracts.
- Testing procedures included agreeing revenue transactions selected for testing through to supporting evidence including sales invoice, contracts and cash receipts.
- Testing a sample of self-billing sales transactions to ensure that the revenue recognition was correct.
- Reviewing material credit notes, invoices and receipts post year end.

- Reviewing material credit notes, invoices and receipts post year end.
- Performing sales cut off tests to ensure revenue had been recognised in the correct period.

 Key observations 
Based on our audit testing we did not identify any material misstatements of revenue. 
We consider that the disclosures in the financial statements relating to this area are adequate. 
 VALUATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL 
The directors are required to make an assessment to determine whether there are impairment indicators relating to the group's goodwill and other intangible assets.

The process for assessing whether impairment exists under International Accounting Standard (IAS) 36 'Impairment of Assets' is complex. The process of determining the value in use, through forecasting cash flows related to each asset and the determination of the appropriate discount rate and other assumptions to be applied, can be highly judgemental and can significantly impact the results of the impairment review.

"We consider that the disclosures in the financial statements relating to this area are adequate. 
 Our application of materiality 
The scope and focus of our audit was influenced by our assessment and application of materiality. We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement that could reasonably be expected to influence the readers and the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. We use materiality to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Due to the nature of the Group we considered revenue to be the main focus for the readers of the financial statements, accordingly this consideration influenced our judgement of materiality. Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the Group to be ВЈ186,000, based on a percentage of revenue.",brave
"On the basis of our risk assessment, together with our assessment of the overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality (i.e. our tolerance for misstatement in an individual account or balance) for the Group was 50% of materiality, namely ВЈ93,000. 
We agreed to report to the Audit Committee all audit differences in excess of ВЈ9,300, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also reported to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
The materiality, performance materiality and trivial threshold for the parent company are ВЈ148,500, ВЈ74,250 and ВЈ7,425 respectively.

 Conclusions relating to going concern 
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the entity's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included a critical assessment of the detailed cash flow projections prepared by the directors, which are based on their current expectations of trading prospects, and obtaining an understanding of all relevant uncertainties. We have factored the impact of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict into our analysis of the risks affecting the ability of the group to continue to trade and meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.",brave
"The group achieved a positive cashflow in the year of ВЈ0.6m including the costs of the acquisition in the year. The cash flow projections to 30 June 2024 prepared by the directors indicate that the group will continue to achieve positive cash inflows throughout 2023 and into 2024. Furthermore, the directors are confident that the group's cash flow projections and profit and loss forecasts are achievable, and the directors are committed to taking any actions available to them to ensure that any shortfall in forecast revenues is mitigated by cost savings. As stated above we have critically assessed the projections and the assumptions underlying them in conducting our work in this area.",brave
"Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

As explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement set out on page 25, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.",brave
"In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group's and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
 Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements",brave
"Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

This description forms part of our auditor's report. 
 Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud 
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of noncompliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.",brave
"The objectives of our audit in respect of fraud, are; to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud; to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud, through designing and implementing appropriate responses to those assessed risks; and to respond appropriately to instances of fraud or suspected fraud identified during the audit. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both management and those charged with governance of the group and the parent company. 
Our approach was as follows:",brave
"Our approach was as follows: 
вЂў We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to the group and the parent company and considered that the most significant are the Companies Act 2006, UK adopted International Accounting Standards, UK financial reporting standards as issued by the Financial Reporting Council, and UK taxation legislation. 
- We obtained an understanding of how the group and the parent company complies with these requirements by discussions with management and those charged with governance.
- We assessed the risk of material misstatement of the financial statements, including the risk of material misstatement due to fraud and how it might occur, by holding discussions with management and those charged with governance.
- We inquired of management and those charged with governance as to any known instances of noncompliance or suspected non-compliance with laws and regulations.",brave
"- We inquired of management and those charged with governance as to any known instances of noncompliance or suspected non-compliance with laws and regulations.
- Based on this understanding, we designed specific appropriate audit procedures to identify instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. This included making enquiries of management and those charged with governance and obtaining additional corroborative evidence as required. 
There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion'

"1 Brave Bison 
Brave Bison Group plc (""the Company"") (formerly Rightster Group plc) was incorporated in England and Wales on 30 October 2013 under the Companies Act 2006 (registration number 08754680) and its registered address is The Varnish Works, 3 Bravingtons Walk, London, N1 9AJ. On 12 November 2013 the Company entered into share exchange agreements to acquire 100% of the issued share capital of Brave Bison Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales on 16 May 2011 and registered at the same address. On 12 November 2013 the Company was admitted to the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) where its ordinary shares are traded. 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2022 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ""Group""). The Group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the CFO's Review on pages 6-7, and Principal Risks and Uncertainties on page 9. In addition, Note 26 to the financial statements includes the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.",brave
"2 Basis of preparation 
 2.1. Going Concern 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future, and at least for 12 months from the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements. The Group is dependent for its working capital requirements on cash generated from operations, and cash holdings. The cash holdings of the Group at 31 December 2022 were ВЈ6.5 million (2021: ВЈ5.9 million). The Group made a profit before tax of ВЈ1.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2022 (2021: ВЈ0.5 million), and generated an increase in cash and cash equivalents in 2022 of ВЈ0.6 million (2021: ВЈ3.2 million). The Group has net assets of ВЈ10.0 million (2021: ВЈ7.5 million).",brave
"The Directors have prepared detailed cash flow projections for the period to 31 December 2023 and for the following 6 month period to 30 June 2024 which are based on their current expectations of trading prospects. The Group achieved positive cashflow of ВЈ1.1 million in H2 2022, and the Board forecasts that the Group will continue to achieve positive cash inflows in 2023. 
The Directors are confident that the Group's cash flow projections are achievable, and are committed to taking any actions available to them to ensure that any shortfall in forecast revenue receipts is mitigated by cost savings. 
The Directors continue to maintain rolling forecasts which are regularly updated.",brave
"The Directors continue to maintain rolling forecasts which are regularly updated. 
The Directors remain confident that the Group has sufficient cash resources for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements and accordingly, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these consolidated financial statements. 
 Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Brave Bison Group plc and all its subsidiary undertakings up to 31 December 2022, with comparative information presented for the year ended 31 December 2021. No profit and loss account is presented for Brave Bison Group plc as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.",brave
"Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to control the financial and operating policies and is exposed to or has rights over variable returns from its involvements with the investee and has the power to affect returns. Brave Bison Group plc obtains and exercises control through more than half of the voting rights for all its subsidiaries. All subsidiaries have a reporting date of 31 December and are consolidated from the acquisition date, which is the date from which control passes to Brave Bison Group plc. 
Entities other than subsidiaries or joint ventures, in which the Group has a participating interest and over whose operating and financial policies the Group exercises significant influence, are treated as associates. The results of associate undertakings are consolidated under the equity method of accounting. The Group applies uniform accounting policies and all intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.",brave
"Unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Where recognised losses on intra-group asset sales are reversed on consolidation, the underlying asset is also tested for impairment from a Group perspective.",brave
"Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The acquisition method involves the recognition at fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities of the subsidiary, at the acquisition date, regardless of whether or not they were recorded in the financial statements of the subsidiary prior to acquisition. On initial recognition, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary are included in the consolidated statement of financial position at their fair values, which are also used as the basis for subsequent measurement in accordance with the Group accounting policies. Goodwill is stated after separating out identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the Group's share of the identifiable net assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.",brave
"Profit or loss and other comprehensive income of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are recognised from the effective date of acquisition, or up to the effective date of disposal, as applicable. 
 2.2. Adoption of new and revised standards 
The Group has applied the following amendments: 
- IFRS 3 Reference to the Conceptual Framework;
- IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before intended use;
- IAS 37 Onerous Contracts: Cost of Fulfilling a Contract; and
- Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018 вЂ“ 2020 Cycle.

"4 Summary of accounting policies 
The Group's presentation and functional currency is ВЈ (Sterling). The financial statements are presented in thousands of pounds (ВЈ000's) unless otherwise stated. 
 4.1. Revenue 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and sales related taxes. 
Revenue is recognised when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity, the costs incurred or to be incurred can be measured reliably, and when the criteria for each of the Group's different activities has been met.",brave
"The determination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent in a transaction involves judgement and is based on an assessment of who controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to a customer. Significant contracts are reviewed for the indicators of control. The Group is deemed to be acting as a principal in all significant contracts. 
Where the Group's contractual performance obligations have been satisfied in advance of invoicing the client then unbilled income is recognised on the Statement of Financial Position. Where the Group's contractual performance obligations have been satisfied less than amounts invoiced then a contract liability is recognised.

"4.3. Government grants 
Government grants are recognised at the fair value of the asset received or receivable when there is reasonable assurance that the grant conditions will be met and the grants will be received. 
A grant that specifies performance conditions is recognised in income when the performance conditions are met. Where a grant does not specify performance conditions it is recognised in income when the proceeds are received or receivable. A grant received before the recognition criteria are satisfied is recognised as a liability. Government grants are presented as a deduction from the related expense. 
 4.4. Foreign currency translation",brave
"4.4. Foreign currency translation 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. 
Any exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were initially recorded are recognised in the profit or loss in the period in which they arise.",brave

The assets and liabilities in the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and related goodwill are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at the actual rate on the date of transaction. The exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries and on income and expenses during the year are recognised in other comprehensive income and taken to the ""translation reserve"" in equity. On disposal of a foreign operation the cumulative translation differences (including, if applicable, gains and losses on related hedges) are transferred to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal. 
 4.5. Segment reporting",brave
"4.5. Segment reporting 
IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments to be identified on the same basis as is used internally for the review of performance and allocation of resources by the Group Chief Executive (chief operating decision maker вЂ“ CODM). 
The Board has reviewed the Group and all revenues are functional activities of a digital media and marketing group, and these activities take place on an integrated basis. The senior executive team review the financial information on 
an integrated basis for the Group as a whole, but view the business as having 2 key pillars, being the Media Network and the Digital Advertising and Technology Services. The Group will provide a split between these two pillars, as well as a split by geographical location. Segmental information is presented in accordance with IFRS 8 for all periods presented within Note 6. 
 4.6. Leasing",brave
"4.6. Leasing 
For any new contracts entered into on or after 1 January 2019, the Group considers whether a contract is, or contains a lease. A lease is defined as 'a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to use an asset (the underlying asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration'. To apply this definition the Group assesses whether the contract meets three key evaluations which are whether: 
- The contract contains an identified asset, which is either explicitly identified in the contract or implicitly specified by being identified at the time the asset is made available to the Group;
- The Group has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset throughout the period of use, considering its rights within the defined scope of the contract; and",brave
"- The Group has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset throughout the period of use, considering its rights within the defined scope of the contract; and
- The Group has the right to direct the use of the identified asset throughout the period of use. The Group assess whether it has the right to direct 'how and for what purpose' the asset is used throughout the period of use. 
At lease commencement date, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which is made up of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any initial direct costs incurred by the Group, an estimate of any costs to dismantle and remove the asset at the end of the lease, and any lease payments made in advance of the lease commencement date (net of any incentives received).",brave
"The Group depreciates the right-of-use assets on a straightline basis from the lease commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The Group also assesses the right-of-use asset for impairment when such indicators exist. 
At the commencement date, the Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments unpaid at that date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate is readily available or the Group's incremental borrowing rate. 
Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability are made up of fixed payments (including in substance fixed), variable payments based on an index or rate, amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee and payments arising from options reasonably certain to be exercised.",brave
"Subsequent to initial measurement, the liability will be reduced for payments made and increased for interest. It is remeasured to reflect any reassessment or modification, or if there are changes in in-substance fixed payments. 
When the lease liability is remeasured, the corresponding adjustment is reflected in the right-of-use asset, or profit and loss if the right-of-use is already reduced to zero. 
The Group has elected to account for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets using the practical expedients. Instead of recognising a right-of-use asset and lease liability, the payments in relation to these are recognised as an expense in the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
On the statement of financial position, right-of-use assets have been included in property, plant and equipment and lease liabilities have been included in trade and other payables. 
 4.7. Property, plant and equipment",brave
"On the statement of financial position, right-of-use assets have been included in property, plant and equipment and lease liabilities have been included in trade and other payables. 
 4.7. Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost less estimated residual value of all property, plant and equipment by equal annual instalments over their expected useful lives less estimated residual values, using the straight line method. The rates generally applicable are: 
- Fixtures & Fittings 3 years or over remaining lease term
- Computer Equipment 3 years 
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.",brave
"- Computer Equipment 3 years 
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss. 
The assets' residual value and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if required, at each balance sheet date. The carrying amount of an asset is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. 
The Group depreciates the right-of-use assets on a straightline basis from the lease commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The Group also assesses the right-ofuse asset for impairment when such indicators exist. 
 4.8. Impairment of property, plant and equipment",brave
"4.8. Impairment of property, plant and equipment 
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.",brave
"If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
 Intangible assets",brave
"Intangible assets 
An intangible asset, which is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance, is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the expected future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and that its cost can be measured reliably. The asset is deemed to be identifiable when it is separable or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights. 
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination, are shown at fair value at the date of the acquisition less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is charged on a straight line basis to profit or loss. The rates applicable, which represent the Directors' best estimate of the useful economic life, are: 
- Customer relationships 5 to 10 years
- Online channel content 3 to 5 years
- Brands 3 years
- Technology 1 to 5 years 
Goodwill is not amortised but is instead reviewed for impairment on an annual basis as outlined below.

At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets and goodwill to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.",brave

If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
 4.10. Development costs 
Expenditure on the research phase of an internal project is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Development costs incurred on specific projects are capitalised when all the following conditions are satisfied: 
- Completion of the asset is technically feasible so that it will be available for use or sale;
- The Group intends to complete the asset and use or sell it;",brave
"- Completion of the asset is technically feasible so that it will be available for use or sale;
- The Group intends to complete the asset and use or sell it;
- The Group has the ability to use or sell the asset and the asset will generate probable future economic benefits (over and above cost);
- There are adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset; and
- The expenditure attributable to the asset during its development can be measured reliably. 
Development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are expensed as incurred. The cost of an internally generated asset comprises all directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce and prepare the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Directly attributable costs include employee (other than Director) costs incurred along with third party costs.",brave
"Judgement by the Directors is applied when deciding whether the recognition requirements for development costs have been met. Judgements are based on the information available at the time when costs are incurred. In addition, all internal activities related to the research and development of new projects is continuously monitored by the Directors. 
 4.11. Investments in associates and joint ventures 
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. The carrying amount of the investment in associates and joint ventures is increased or decreased to recognise the Group's share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture, adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies of the Group. 
 4.12. Taxation 
Tax expenses recognised in profit or loss comprise the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax not recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.",brave
"4.12. Taxation 
Tax expenses recognised in profit or loss comprise the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax not recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. 
 Current tax 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
 Deferred tax",brave
"Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and are accounted for using the liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be recognised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to recognise the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.",brave
"The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset recognised based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.",brave
"4.13. Financial Instruments 
 Recognition and derecognition 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised with the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards are transferred. A financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished, discharged, cancelled or expires. 
 Loan and other receivables 
The Group accounts for loan and other receivables by recording the loss allowance as lifetime expected credit losses. These are shortfalls in contractual cash flows, considering the potential for default at any point during the life of the financial instrument. The Group uses its historical experience, external indicators and forwardlooking information to calculate expected credit losses. 
 Trade and other payables",brave
"Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method. 
 Contract assets and liabilities 
The Group does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the entity expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. 
 4.14. Equity, reserves and dividend payments 
 Share capital 
Share capital represents the nominal value of shares that have been issued.

 Retained deficits 
Retained deficits include all current and prior period retained profits or losses. It also includes credits arising from share based payment charges. 
 Translation reserve 
Translation reserve represents the differences arising from translation of investments in overseas subsidiaries. 
 Merger reserve 
The merger reserve is created when group reconstruction accounting is applied. The difference between the cost of investment and the nominal value of the share capital acquired is recognised in a merger reserve. 
 Merger relief reserve

"Merger relief reserve 
Where the following conditions are met, any excess consideration received over the nominal value of the shares issued is recognised in the merger relief reserve: 
- the consideration for shares in another company includes issued shares; and
- on completion of the transaction, the company issuing the shares will have secured at least a 90% equity holding in the other company. 
 Capital redemption reserve 
Where the Company purchases its own equity share capital, on cancellation, the nominal value of the shares cancelled is deducted from share capital and the amount is transferred to the capital redemption reserve. 
Dividend distributions payable to equity shareholders are included in 'other liabilities' when the dividends have been approved in a general meeting prior to the reporting date.

 4.17. Share based payments 
Employees (including Directors) of the Group received remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for rights over shares ('equity-settled transactions'). The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payments to all grants of equity instruments. The transactions have been treated as equity settled.",brave
"The cost of equity settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the grant date of the equity instrument granted. The fair value is determined by using the Black-Scholes method. The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding charge to equity, over the period between the date of grant and the end of a vesting period, where relevant employees become fully entitled to the award. The total value of the options has been pro-rated and allocated on a weighted average basis.

 4.19. Provisions 
The Group has recognised a provision for the costs to restore leased property to its original condition, as required by the terms and conditions of the lease. This is recognised when the obligation is incurred, either at the commencement date or as a consequence of having used the underlying asset during a particular period of the lease, at the directors' best estimate of the expenditure that would be required to restore the assets. Estimates are regularly reviewed and adjusted as appropriate for new circumstances.",brave
"5 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The preparation of financial statements under UK adopted International Accounting Standards requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions which have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are discussed below. 
 5.1. Critical accounting judgements 
 Intangible assets and impairment",brave
"5.1. Critical accounting judgements 
 Intangible assets and impairment 
The Group recognises the intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations at fair value at the date of acquisition. The determination of these fair values is determined by experts engaged by management and based upon management's and the Directors' judgement and includes assumptions on the timing and amount of future incremental cash flows generated by the assets and selection of an appropriate discount rate. Furthermore management must estimate the expected useful lives of intangible assets and charge amortisation on these assets accordingly. 
 Trade receivables' recovery",brave
"Trade receivables' recovery 
Within trade debtors there is a balance of ВЈ0.7 million (2021: ВЈ0.7 million) which is over one year in age which the Group has judged it not necessary to provide for. This is because it believes it is recoverable, since there is a trade payable balance of ВЈ0.8 million (2021: ВЈ0.8 million) with the same company, and the Group is anticipating reaching agreement that these balances may be set off against each other. 
 Treatment of revenue as agent or principal",brave
"Treatment of revenue as agent or principal 
The determination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent in a transaction involves judgment and is based on an assessment of who controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to a customer. Significant contracts are reviewed for the indicators of control. These include if the Group is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the good or service, if the Group has inventory risk before the good or services has been transferred to the customer and if the Group has discretion in establishing the price for the good or service. 
 Deferred taxation 
Deferred tax assets are recognised in respect of tax loss carry forwards only to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.

"Deferred taxation 
Deferred tax assets are recognised in respect of tax loss carry forwards only to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable. 
 Greenlight acquisition and purchase price allocation 
The purchase price allocation of the Greenlight acquisition was fully assessed in the year, within the one year IFRS 3 measurement period from the date of acquisition, and acquired intangibles were identified and a full valuation exercise carried out in relation to the Greenlight trade name and the customer relationships. The purchase price has been reallocated accordingly. 
 Best Response Media acquisition and purchase price allocation",brave
"Best Response Media acquisition and purchase price allocation 
The purchase price allocation of the Best Response Media acquisition was provisionally assessed, and the Group judged that at the interim valuation stage it was not able to reliably estimate the fair value of acquired intangibles and therefore the excess of consideration over fair value of other assets and liabilities has been allocated to goodwill. A full valuation exercise will be completed within the one year IFRS3 measurement period from the date of acquisition which may recognise additional intangible assets separately from goodwill. 
 5.2. Estimates 
 Share based payment charges",brave
"5.2. Estimates 
 Share based payment charges 
The Group is required to measure the fair value of its share based payments. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes method which requires assumptions regarding exchange rate volatility, the risk free rate, share price volatility and the expected life of the share based payment. Exchange rate volatility is calculated using historic data over the past three years. The volatility of the Group's share price has been calculated as the average of similar listed companies over the preceding periods. The risk-free rate range used is between 0% and 1.25% and management, including the Directors, have estimated the expected life of most share based payments to be 4 years. 
 Bad debt provision",brave
"Bad debt provision 
Recoverability of some receivables may be doubtful although not definitely irrecoverable. Where management feel recoverability is in doubt an appropriate provision is made for the possibility that the amounts may not be recovered in full. Provisions are made using past experience however subjectivity is involved when assessing the level of provision required.",brave

Within trade debtors there is a balance of ВЈ0.7 million which is over one year in age which the Group has judged it not necessary to provide for.

The Group has carried out an interim fair value adjustment exercise and will be completing a full exercise within the one year measurement period from the date of the acquisition in accordance with IFRS3. At the interim valuation stage the Group has not been able to reliably estimate the fair value of acquired intangibles and therefore the excess of consideration over fair value of other identifiable assets and liabilities has been allocated to goodwill.

The Directors remain confident that the Group has sufficient cash resources for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of these financial statements and accordingly, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements. 
 Deferred taxation",brave
"Deferred tax represents the future tax consequences of transactions and events recognised in the financial statements of current and previous periods. It is recognised in respect of all timing differences, with certain exceptions. Timing differences are differences between taxable profits and total comprehensive income as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of income and expense in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements. Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits. Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date that are expected to apply to the reversal of timing differences. Deferred tax on revalued non-depreciable tangible fixed assets and investment properties is measured using the rates and allowances that apply to the sale of the asset.",brave
"Investments 
Investments are recognised initially at fair value which is normally the transaction price excluding transaction costs. Subsequently, they are measured at cost less impairment. 
 Debtors 
Debtors are stated in the balance sheet at estimated net realisable value.

The fair value is determined by using the Black-Scholes method. The cost of equity-settled transactions are recognised, together with a corresponding credit to equity, over the period between the date of grant and the end of vesting period, where relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.

"Chairman's Statement 
I am pleased to present my annual statement to Shareholders for the year ended 30 September 2022 and the twenty-second since the Company was formed in 2000. 
 Results for the year 
The continuing impact of the global pandemic and the ongoing war in Eastern Europe and its effect on energy supplies have dominated the financial news this year for Starvest and its portfolio companies. Starvest's strategy to steer its portfolio toward precious metal investments in recent years has enabled the Company to position itself attractively for the current environment. Although improved investor sentiment boosted certain precious metal stocks and those of certain other natural resource companies, gold prices declined 5.5% for the year ended 30 September 2022. The post-pandemic global economy and interest rate hikes, particularly in the US, have kept prices flat recently but we continue to believe that there is a solid foundation for precious metals going forward.",starvest
"Our investment portfolio decreased approximately 56% in the year to 30 September 2022 to ВЈ6 million. However, the discount to net asset value narrowed by 5 percentage points, from 34% to 29% as at 30 September 2022, which is a significant improvement for shareholders. 
Greatland Gold plc (AIM:GGP) remains our primary investment, with its Havieron gold-copper discovery in Australia. Havieron's initial inferred resource increased from 4.2M oz gold equivalent to 6.5M oz gold equivalent during the year. The company secured funding through to production, expanded its board, and delivered operational and financial improvements. While the share price has decreased over the last year, this is not uncommon for a company in pre-production and we continue to see potential gains here.",starvest
"Ariana Resources continues to expand its exploration and development footprint in Europe. As the Kiziltepe mine has continued to meet production expectations, Ariana has focused on other projects in Turkey, such as Tavsan, which is scheduled for first production in H2 2023. The alliance with Newmont, via its West Tethyan holding, allows considerable scope to explore southeastern Europe over the next five years, and the recently acquired Kosovo licence shows an interesting start to this US$2.5m agreement. Together with the Asgard Metals Fund, Ariana's exploration and development projects have expanded considerably since the company's founding twenty years ago. 
Cora Gold continued to de-risk its Sanankoro project as it completed further drilling and increased its mineral resource estimate by 14% while completing a feasibility study. After year-end the company announced that it had received the Environmental Permit required for the project, a significant step forward.",starvest
"We believe that the long-term outlook for gold prices remains favourable and we remain committed to our strategy.

"Investing policy statement 
 About us 
The previous Board commenced to manage the Company as an investment company in January 2002, largely investing in the natural resources sector. Following the appointment of Callum Baxter as Chairman in 2015, the Board continued to focus the Company's investment strategy on the natural resources sector. 
Collectively, the current Board has significant experience investing in small-capitalisation new issues and pre-IPO opportunities in the natural resources and mineral exploration sectors. 
 Company objective 
The Company was established as a source of early-stage finance to fledgling businesses to maximise the capital value of the Company and to generate benefits for Shareholders in the form of capital growth and modest dividends. 
 Investing strategy",starvest
"Company objective 
The Company was established as a source of early-stage finance to fledgling businesses to maximise the capital value of the Company and to generate benefits for Shareholders in the form of capital growth and modest dividends. 
 Investing strategy 
Natural resources: Whilst the Company's investment mandate is not exclusively limited to natural resources, the Board sees this sector as having considerable growth potential in the medium term. Historically, investments were generally made immediately prior to an initial public offering on AIM or AQSE as well as in the aftermarket. As the nature of the public equity markets has changed since 2008, it is more likely that the future investment portfolio will include companies that have completed an IPO but remain in the early stages of identifying or, with the appropriate financial backing, developing a commercial resource.",starvest
"Direct Projects: The Company's strategy is to invest predominantly through ownership of equity stakes in target companies. However, the Company believes there may be opportunities to take direct interests in mining projects and subsequently to acquire equity positions in target companies on favourable terms in exchange for these direct project interests. Those companies would therefore become Starvest investee companies. The projects will be operated by the investee company; Starvest does not intend to manage any projects. The addition of the Direct Project strategy to the Company's Investing Policy was approved by shareholders at the Company's annual general meeting held 1 December 2017.",starvest
"Investment size: Initial investments are usually not greater than ВЈ100,000. Target companies invariably have an ongoing need for additional funding to continue exploration and development. Therefore, after appropriate due diligence, the Company may provide further funding support and make later market purchases, so that the total investment may exceed ВЈ100,000. 
High risk: The business is inherently high risk and cyclical, dependent upon fluctuations in world economic activity which affects the demand for minerals. However, the Company affords investors the opportunity to participate in diverse early-stage ventures, which the Board believes will offer the potential for significant returns for the foreseeable future.",starvest
"Lack of liquidity: Shares of investee companies typically trade in small volumes, even if they are quoted on AIM, AQSE, ASX, or TSX-V. Therefore, during the early phase following an investment, it is rarely possible to liquidate a position at the quoted market price so investors must remain patient until the investee company develops and ultimately attracts greater market interest. If and when an exploration company finds a large exploitable resource, it typically presents greater liquidity to patient investors as an acquisition target by a third party or as a much larger and more actively traded independent entity.",starvest
"Success rate: Of the multiple investments held at any one time, it is expected that no more than five will prove to be 'winners'; from half of the remainder we may expect to see modest share price improvements. Overall, we expect that over time portfolio returns will be acceptable if not substantial. Accordingly, the Board is unable to give any estimate of the magnitude or timing of returns. 
Profit distribution: When profits have been realised, and adequate cash is available, the Board intends to distribute up to half the profits realised.",starvest
"Introduction 
During the year to 30 September 2022, the portfolio comprised interests in the companies discussed below, as well as other active companies that are not discussed herein. 
The economic shock of the global pandemic continued throughout 2022 and investors' desire for traditional safehaven assets boosted precious metals stocks at times. However, supply chain issues and European conflict led to rising energy prices, broader-based inflation and a shift in economic policies which caused market reactions and precious metal price fluctuations as well as an overall decline year on year in metal prices when forecasts for growth were downgraded. In this environment, we believe our strategy to focus on investments in gold producers will prove to be rewarding on a risk-adjusted basis for our shareholders. However, during the year to 30 September 2022, the value of our trading portfolio decreased ~56% due to lower market prices for major positions. Including our cash position, our net asset value (""NAV"") and NAV per share decreased 53.4% and 53.7%, respectively, over the 12-month period to 30 September 2022. Given that Starvest's market capitalisation decreased approximately 49%, the discount to NAV narrowed to 29% compared to 34% a year ago.",starvest
"Trading portfolio valuation 
Although gold prices declined slightly (~5%) year on year, this change masked greater volatility during the 12 month period. The Company's Net Asset Value decreased approximately 53% during the year to 30 September 2022 to ВЈ6.6m and the Company made a loss before tax of ВЈ7,540,842 compared with a loss before tax of ВЈ3,861,014 in 2021. 
However, we are pleased that the Company traded at an improved discount to its NAV of 29% compared to 34% the previous year. 
As part of routine operations, the Board regularly reviews its portfolio positions and may make adjustments to its holdings to take advantage of what it believes to be temporary weakness in prices for precious metals. Alternatively, the Board may consider strategic opportunities to better align the Company's stock price with what it regards as the intrinsic value of the Company's portfolio. 
Given the availability of actual trading prices for many of our portfolio assets, we value our holdings using closing market quotes for the periods shown. 
In addition, the Company believes it has a strong financial position as it has no outstanding debt and is wellpositioned to benefit from further strength in the natural resources sector through its exposure to early-stage precious metal producers. We believe that worldwide economic growth and increasingly affluent consumers will fuel demand for motor cars, air conditioning, consumer goods, computers, together with materials required in switching to 'greener' technologies and other items that require the development and exploitation of natural resources in order both to produce and power.",starvest

 Review of the current market 
Global markets and gold prices fluctuated throughout the year; with economies and governments trying to rebalance and adjust to continuing post-pandemic and energy related uncertainties. 
The price of gold fluctuated throughout the year with a peak of US$1,998 per troy ounce in March 2022 and a low of US$1,629 in September 2022 but has remained at elevated prices relative to the last decade. Copper, nickel, lead and zinc are all down year on year based on inflation and forecasted recessions.",starvest
"Overall, investors are demonstrating greater interest in the natural resources sector, as the market looks forward to economic growth, 'green' technology investments, and further government stimulus via major infrastructure projects; long-term natural resources are still vital commodities and demand is forecast to increase. 
The current market conditions allow for measured, strategic investment in undervalued, early-stage natural resource projects.",starvest

Greatland Gold plc (""Greatland""), an AIM-listed exploration company, represents by far the largest part of the Company's portfolio and holds six exploration projects, four in Western Australia and two in Tasmania. Greatland also has farm-in and joint venture agreements in place with its major partner, Newcrest Mining Ltd.",starvest
"The company, in conjunction with Newcrest, has continued to report excellent drilling results from the Havieron project and increased its Initial Inferred Mineral Resource estimate, independently of Newcrest, from 4.2Moz AuEq to 6.5Moz AuEq in March 2022. The increased estimate was ratified in August 2022 when Newcrest released its own resource upgrade. Neither resource takes into account drilling carried out after February 2022, which could yield a significant increase in resource if included. Drilling to date has not yet closed off the deposit, with Havieron remaining open at depth and in multiple directions, allowing for significant resource growth in the future.",starvest
"In addition, Greatland took several corporate and financial actions this year. Newcrest boosted its stake in Havieron to 70% but declined to exercise an option to acquire an additional 5% of the project. Greatland subsequently raised US$35m in an over-subscribed placing and is well-funded to continue exploration and funding its part of the Havieron development. In September 2022, the company announced that two former Fortescue Metals Group executives would join the board in January 2023 and also added a former BHP executive, all of whom add a new dynamic to Greatland's leadership team and are able to take the company forward as a significant mid-tier developer in the near term. Around the same time, the company entered into a significant finance agreement, with a bank debt facility of A$200m committed through a syndicate of leading international banks and secured a strategic equity investment of up to A$120m from Wyloo Metals, which will fund Greatland fully through to production.",starvest
"Significant activities since year end: Greatland announced that drilling permits have been granted on the Ernest Giles licence. Havieron drilling updates continue to confirm the potential to greatly expand the size of this deposit with high-grade extensions to mineralisation in the Eastern Breccia, South East Crescent Zone and Northern Breccia. The mine decline is at over 900m development length and now in more competent rock. The feasibility study is due during 2023 and will likely include more up to date drilling data once completed thus further de-risking the project. 
Greatland entered into an option agreement to sell its two Tasmania exploration licences to Flynn Gold for an initial purchase price of A$200,000 with deferred consideration and a royalty equal to 1% net smelter returns from any future production.",starvest

Post-COVID-19 global economics has had an impact on the company's investments and their activities, however all investments held by the company are Level 1 investments and hence the value at the balance sheet date approximates the fair value which can be liquidated in order to settle the company's liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future.",starvest

"The Company is established as a source of early stage finance to fledgling businesses, to maximise the capital value of the Company and to generate benefits for Shareholders in the form of capital growth and modest dividends. 
 Investing strategy 
Natural resources: Whilst the Company's investment mandate is not exclusively limited to natural resources, the Board sees this sector as having considerable growth potential in the medium term. Historically, investments were generally made immediately prior to an initial public offering on AIM or AQSE as well as in the aftermarket. As the nature of the market has changed since 2008, it is more likely that the future investment portfolio will include companies that have completed an IPO but remain in the early stages of identifying or, with the appropriate financial backing, developing a commercial resource.",starvest
"Direct Project: The Company's strategy is to invest predominantly through ownership of equity stakes in target companies. However, the Company believes there may be opportunities to take direct interests in mining projects and subsequently to acquire equity positions in target companies on favourable terms in exchange for these direct project interests; those companies would therefore become Starvest investee companies. The projects will be operated by the investee company; Starvest will not manage any project. Prior to selling any projects to corporate entities, Starvest may therefore have an interest in a number of projects. The addition of the Direct Project strategy to the Company's Investing Policy was approved by shareholders at the Company's annual general meeting held 1 December 2017.",starvest
"Investment size: Initial investments are usually not greater than ВЈ100,000. Target companies are invariably not generating cash, but rather they have a constant need for additional funding in order to continue exploration and development. Therefore, after appropriate due diligence, the Company may provide further funding support and make later market purchases, so that the total investment may be greater than ВЈ100,000.",starvest
"Corporate governance statement, continued 
High risk: The business is inherently high risk and cyclical in nature dependent upon fluctuations in world economic activity which impacts on the demand for minerals. However, the Company affords investors the opportunity to participate in diverse early-stage ventures, which the Board believes will offer the potential for significant returns for the foreseeable future.",starvest
"Lack of liquidity: The investee companies, being small, almost invariably lack share market liquidity, even if they are quoted on AIM, AQSE, ASX, or TSX-V. Therefore, in the early years it is rarely possible to sell an investment at the quoted market price with the result that extreme patience is required whilst the investee company develops and ultimately attracts market interest.

The basis for calculating materiality is unchanged from the previous year, with the reduction reflecting the fall in fair value of equity investments at year-end. The benchmark used is the one which we determined, in our professional judgment, to be the key benchmark within the financial statements relevant to shareholders of an investment management company in assessing financial performance. The key driver of the company and assessment of its performance is linked to the valuation of its equity investments held. Performance materiality has been set at ВЈ128,800 (2021: ВЈ295,400) being 70% of headline materiality, based upon our assessment of risk and the absence of any audit adjustments in previous periods.",starvest
"We agreed to report to those charged with governance all corrected and uncorrected misstatements we identified through our audit with a value in excess of ВЈ9,000 (2021: ВЈ21,100). We also agreed to report any other audit misstatements below that threshold that we believe warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF STARVEST PLC, continued Our approach to the audit 
In designing our audit, we determined materiality, and assessed the risk of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we looked at areas where the Directors made significant judgements, comprising the fair value of investments at level 2 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We also assessed the risk of management override of internal controls. 
 Key audit matters",starvest
"Key audit matters 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

The Directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

 Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: 
- the information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
- the strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. 
 Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report. 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:",starvest
"We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

- the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
- certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or
- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
 Responsibilities of directors 
As explained more fully in the statement of directors' responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.",starvest
"In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. 
 Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements",starvest
"Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.",starvest
"Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below: 
We obtained an understanding of the company and the sector in which it operates to identify laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a direct effect on the financial statements. We obtained our understanding in this regard through discussions with management and application of cumulative audit knowledge.

- We determined the principal laws and regulations relevant to the company in this regard to be those arising from:
t- Companies Act 2006
t- FRS 102

- We designed our audit procedures to ensure the audit team considered whether there were any indications of non-compliance by the company with those laws and regulations. These procedures included, but were not limited to:
t- Enquiries of management
t- Review of board minutes and other correspondence
t- Review of the company's related party transactions and disclosures
- We also identified the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud. We considered, in addition to the non-rebuttable presumption of a risk of fraud arising from management override of controls, that the existence and good title to investments represented the greatest risk of fraud.",starvest
"- We addressed the risk of fraud arising from management override of controls by performing audit procedures which included, but were not limited to: the testing of journals and evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business. 
Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including those leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation. This risk increases the more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance. The risk is also greater regarding irregularities occurring due to fraud rather than error, as fraud involves intentional concealment, forgery, collusion, omission or misrepresentation.",starvest

"2. Basis of Preparation 
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 вЂ“ 'The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland' ('FRS102'), and with the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis. There are no fair value adjustments other than to the carrying value of the Company's trade investments. The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is also the functional currency of the company. 
 Going concern 
The Company's day to day financing is from its available cash resources and, on occasion, by the part disposal of investments and use of short-term loans. 
The Directors are confident that adequate funding can be raised as required to meet the Company's current and future liabilities, which has been confirmed within the cash flow forecast prepared by the Board for the 12 months ending 29 February 2024. In the unlikely event that such finance could not be raised, the Directors could raise sufficient funds by disposal of certain of its current asset trade investments. 
As at the date of this report, the Company has no borrowings. 
For the reasons outlined above, the Directors are satisfied that the Company will be able to meet its current and future liabilities, and continue trading, for the foreseeable future and, in any event, for a period of not less than twelve months from the date of approving the financial statements. The preparation of the financial statements on a going concern basis is therefore considered to remain appropriate.",starvest
"3. Principal Accounting Policies 
 Administrative expenses 
All administrative expenses are stated inclusive of VAT, where applicable, as the company is not eligible to reclaim VAT incurred on its costs. 
 Taxation 
Corporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits at the current rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Under FRS102, investments are valued on a mark-to-market basis using publicly quoted trading prices at year end irrespective of whether they are classified as fixed or current assets.вЂЇ However, pursuant to Part 3, Chapter 3, Corporation Tax Act 2009, any increase in the value of a current asset is recognised as a trading profit and immediately subject to Corporation Tax when a company is classified as a trading company under HMRC rules and regulations, whereas an increase in the value of a fixed asset is not subject to taxation until the asset is disposed of when a company is classified as an investment company. Reported profit under UK GAAP is unaffected.",starvest

 3. Principal Accounting Policies, continued 
 Taxation, continued 
Historically, the Company's previous board had filed as a trading company and described its investment portfolio as a current asset. Following a comprehensive review of various factors related to the Company's investment portfolio and strategy, including, among others, the frequency, timing, liquidity, trading activities, development stage and investment horizon of such investments individually and the portfolio as a whole, the Company's current board have determined the Company is appropriately classified as an investment company, and the investment portfolio is properly accounted for among the Company's fixed assets. The Board do not consider this to be a change in accounting policy; rather, it is a correction in presentation to reflect more accurately the factual position. 
 Deferred tax",starvest
"Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is provided on an undiscounted full provision basis on all timing differences which have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date using rates of tax enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits and are recognised within debtors. The deferred tax assets and liabilities all relate to the same legal entity and being due to or from the same tax authority are offset on the balance sheet.",starvest
"FRS 102 requires that investments are valued each year on the mark-to-market basis and the revaluation differences are reflected in the profit and loss account. However, the tax on any unrealised profit is calculated and shown in the accounts as if the profit had been realised, but there is then an adjustment in the deferred tax to move the tax that relates to the unrealised profit to the balance sheet. 
 Foreign Currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the reporting date, unless specifically covered by foreign exchange contracts whereupon the contract rate is used. 
 Investments 
Current investments are stated at mid-market publicly quoted prices.",starvest
"Investments 
Current investments are stated at mid-market publicly quoted prices. 
Investments in unlisted company shares are remeasured to available market values, or Directors' valuations at each balance sheet date. Gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for the period. As at 30 September 2022 unlisted shares were valued at ВЈnil (2021: ВЈnil). 
Investments in listed company shares are remeasured to market value at each balance sheet date under level 1 of the fair value hierachy. Gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for the period.

 c) Deferred tax, continued 
A deferred tax liability provision of ВЈ1,671,086 has been released during the year (2021: ВЈ332,532) on the future tax payable on profits, on disposal of investments. 
The Company has not recognised a deferred tax asset due to the inherent uncertainty that future investment gains will offset such a tax asset. 
In May 2021, the UK Government enacted a budget that increased the corporation tax rate to 25% from the current rate of 19%. The deferred tax liabilities in these accounts have been adjusted to reflect these enacted tax rates. 
 8. Earnings Per Share 
The basic earnings per share is derived by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue.

 Credit Risk 
The Company's credit risk arises primarily from short term loans to related parties and the risk the counterparty fails to discharge its obligations. At 30 September 2022 there were no loans outstanding (2021: ВЈnil). 
 Liquidity Risk 
Liquidity risk arises from the management of cash funds and working capital. The risk is that the Company will fail to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company operates within the constraints of available funds and cash flow projections are produced and regularly reviewed by management. 
 Interest rate risk profile of financial assets 
The only financial assets (other than short term debtors) are cash at bank and in hand, which comprises money at call. The interest earned in the year was negligible. The Directors believe the fair value of the financial instruments is not materially different to the book value. 
 Foreign currency risk",starvest
"Foreign currency risk 
The Company has no material exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. 
 Market risk 
The Company is exposed to market risk in that the value of its investments would be expected to vary depending on trading activity of its shares.

"Review of Operations 
The Company has successfully managed the COVID interruption to our business and global supply chain shortage and reported a profit in the current reporting period. 
As the ASX announcement dated 9 February 2022, we received purchase orders totalling approximately USD 20 million from one of our major customers in the first half-year of 2022. Our international procurement team has secured the required manufacturing materials and is committed to delivering products to all customers with our best efforts. 
The Company has continued work on the ERP system implementation as part of the Digital Enterprise Transformation. The first phase of ERP implementation has been completed, with Australia and Singapore subsidiaries consolidated into one platform. Phase 2 will bring the entire Company onto a unified platform that will significantly enhance efficiencies and business intelligence. The Company expects phase 2 of the ERP system implementation to begin in the first half-year of 2023 and take 12 months to implement.",rectifier
"Outlook 
To increase the competitiveness of RT22, the Company decided to significantly raise the technical benchmark for the product, which pushed back the original deadlines but resulted in a superior product. The engineering of the 'RT22 50KW EV Charger Module' has continued throughout the period. It has included the safety certification by TUV SUD, which is to be completed by Q4 2022, to enable our customers to supply the product in Europe and the USA. In addition, engineering has continued to work on the volume release of the product by validating a range of alternative components to ensure the supply chain meets market demand for the product. We are expecting RT22 to contribute significantly to company revenue in 2023. For personal use only 
On 26 July 2022, the Company announced that the 'Highbury DC Bi-Directional Charger' project was put on hold, and the available engineering resources have been deployed to other developments, such as the 'RT22 50KW EV Charger Module' and 'high-voltage input rectifier', which are now scheduled H1 2023.

"Principles used to determine the nature and amount of remuneration 
The objective of the consolidated entity's executive reward framework is to ensure reward for performance is competitive and appropriate for the results delivered. The framework aligns executive reward with the achievement of strategic objectives and the creation of value for shareholders, and it is considered to conform to the market best practice for the delivery of reward. The Board of Directors ('the Board') ensures that executive reward satisfies the following key criteria for good reward governance practices: 
- competitiveness and reasonableness;
- acceptability to shareholders;
- performance linkage/alignment of executive compensation; and
- transparency.",rectifier
"- competitiveness and reasonableness;
- acceptability to shareholders;
- performance linkage/alignment of executive compensation; and
- transparency. 
The Board is responsible for determining and reviewing remuneration arrangements for its directors and executives. The performance of the consolidated entity depends on the quality of its directors and executives. The remuneration philosophy is to attract, motivate and retain high-performance and high-quality personnel. 
! 
The reward framework is designed to align executive reward to shareholders' interests. The Board has considered that it should seek to enhance shareholders' interests by: 
- having economic profit as a core component of plan design;
- focusing on sustained growth in shareholder wealth, consisting of dividends and growth in share price, and delivering
- constant or increasing return on assets as well as focusing the executive on key non-financial drivers of value; and",rectifier
"- having economic profit as a core component of plan design;
- focusing on sustained growth in shareholder wealth, consisting of dividends and growth in share price, and delivering
- constant or increasing return on assets as well as focusing the executive on key non-financial drivers of value; and
- attracting and retaining high calibre executives. 
Additionally, the reward framework should seek to enhance executives' interests by: 
- rewarding capability and experience
- reflecting competitive reward for contribution to growth in shareholder wealth
- providing a clear structure for earning rewards 
In accordance with best practice corporate governance, the remuneration structure of non-executive director and executive director is separate.",rectifier
"Executive remuneration 
The consolidated entity aims to reward executives based on their position and responsibility, with a level and mix of remuneration which has both fixed and variable components. 
The executive remuneration and reward framework has four components: 
- base pay and non-monetary benefits;
- short-term performance incentives;
- share-based payments; and
- other remuneration such as superannuation and long service leave. 
The combination of these comprises the executive's total remuneration. 
Fixed remuneration, consisting of base salary, superannuation and non-monetary benefits, is reviewed annually by the Board based on individual and business unit performance, the overall performance of the consolidated entity and comparable market remunerations.",rectifier
"Fixed remuneration, consisting of base salary, superannuation and non-monetary benefits, is reviewed annually by the Board based on individual and business unit performance, the overall performance of the consolidated entity and comparable market remunerations. 
Executives may receive their fixed remuneration in the form of cash or other fringe benefits (for example motor vehicle benefits), which does not create any additional costs to the consolidated entity and provides additional value to the executive. 
The short-term incentives ('STI') program is designed to align the targets of the business units with the performance hurdles of executives. STI payments are granted to executives based on specific annual targets and key performance indicators ('KPI's') being achieved. KPI's include profit contribution, customer satisfaction, leadership contribution and product management.",rectifier
"The long-term incentives ('LTI') include long service leave and share-based payments. Shares are awarded to executives in accordance with performance guidelines established by the Board. These include increase in shareholders' value relative to the entire market and the increase compared to the consolidated entity's direct competitors. The Board reviewed the longterm equity-linked performance incentives specifically for executives during the year ended 30 June 2022. 
!",rectifier
"Consolidated entity performance and link to remuneration 
As part of each executive director and executive's remuneration package there may be a performance-based component, consisting of key performance indicators (KPI's). The intention of this program is to facilitate goal congruence between directors/executives with that of the business and shareholders. Where applicable, the KPI's are set annually, with a certain level of consultation with directors/executives to ensure buy-in. The measures are specifically tailored to the areas each director/executive is involved in and has a level of control over. The KPI's target areas the Board believes hold greater potential for the consolidated entity expansion and profit, covering financial and non-financial as well as short-term and longterm goals. The level set for each KPI is based on budgeted figures for the consolidated entity and respective industry standards. For personal use only",rectifier
"Performance in relation to the KPI's is assessed annually, with bonuses being awarded depending on the number and deemed difficulty of the KPI's achieved. Following the assessment, the KPI's are reviewed by the Board in light of the desired and actual outcomes, and their efficiency is assessed in relation to the consolidated entity's goals and shareholder wealth before the KPI's are set for the following year. 
In determining whether or not a KPI has been achieved, Rectifier Technologies Ltd bases the assessment on audited figures; however, where the KPI involves comparison of individual performance within the consolidated entity, management reports which form the foundation for the consolidated entity audited results are used. 
Refer to the section 'Additional information' below for details of the earnings and total shareholders return for the last five years.",rectifier

"Principles of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries of Rectifier Technologies Ltd ('Company' or 'parent entity') as at 30 June 2022 and the results of all subsidiaries for the year ended. Rectifier Technologies Ltd and its subsidiaries together are referred to in these financial statements as the 'consolidated entity'. 
! 
Subsidiaries are all those entities over which the consolidated entity has control. The consolidated entity controls an entity when the consolidated entity is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the consolidated entity. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.",rectifier
"Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between entities in the consolidated entity are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the consolidated entity. For personal use only 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. A change in ownership interest, without the loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction, where the difference between the consideration transferred and the book value of the share of the non-controlling interest acquired is recognised directly in equity attributable to the parent.",rectifier
"Where the consolidated entity loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets including goodwill, liabilities and non-controlling interest in the subsidiary together with any cumulative translation differences recognised in equity. The consolidated entity recognises the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any investment retained together with any gain or loss in profit or loss.",rectifier
"Revenue from contracts with customers 
Revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the consolidated entity is expected to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. For each contract with a customer, the consolidated entity: identifies the contract with a customer; identifies the performance obligations in the contract; determines the transaction price which takes into account estimates of variable consideration and the time value of money; allocates the transaction price to the separate performance obligations on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling price of each distinct good or service to be delivered; and recognises revenue when or as each performance obligation is satisfied in a manner that depicts the transfer to the customer of the goods or services promised. 
! 
Variable consideration within the transaction price, if any, reflects concessions provided to the customer such as discounts, rebates and refunds, any potential bonuses receivable from the customer and any other contingent events. Such estimates are determined using either the 'expected value' or 'most likely amount' method. The measurement of variable consideration is subject to a constraining principle whereby revenue will only be recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur. The measurement constraint continues until the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Amounts received that are subject to the constraining principle are recognised as a refund liability. For personal use only",rectifier
"Income tax 
The income tax expense or benefit for the period is the tax payable on that period's taxable income based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction, adjusted by the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences, unused tax losses and the adjustment recognised for prior periods, where applicable. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences at the tax rates expected to be applied when the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled, based on those tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted, except for: 
- When the deferred income tax asset or liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting nor taxable profits; or",rectifier
"- When the deferred income tax asset or liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting nor taxable profits; or
- When the taxable temporary difference is associated with interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures, and the timing of the reversal can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.",rectifier
"Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. 
The carrying amount of recognised and unrecognised deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date. Deferred tax assets recognised are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that future taxable profits will be available for the carrying amount to be recovered. Previously unrecognised deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there are future taxable profits available to recover the asset.",rectifier
"Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and deferred tax assets against deferred tax liabilities; and they relate to the same taxable authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend to settle simultaneously. 
! 
Rectifier Technologies Ltd (the 'head entity') and its wholly-owned Australian subsidiaries have formed an income tax consolidated group under the tax consolidation regime. The head entity and each subsidiary in the tax consolidated group continue to account for their own current and deferred tax amounts. The tax consolidated group has applied the 'separate taxpayer within group' approach in determining the appropriate amount of taxes to allocate to members of the tax consolidated group.",rectifier
"In addition to its own current and deferred tax amounts, the head entity also recognises the current tax liabilities (or assets) and the deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and unused tax credits assumed from each subsidiary in the tax consolidated group. 
Assets or liabilities arising under tax funding agreements with the tax consolidated entities are recognised as amounts receivable from or payable to other entities in the tax consolidated group. The tax funding arrangement ensures that the intercompany charge equals the current tax liability or benefit of each tax consolidated group member, resulting in neither a contribution by the head entity to the subsidiaries nor a distribution by the subsidiaries to the head entity.",rectifier
"Current and non-current classification 
Assets and liabilities are presented in the statement of financial position based on current and non-current classification. 
An asset is classified as current when: it is either expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the consolidated entity's normal operating cycle; it is held primarily for the purpose of trading; it is expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting period, or the asset is cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. All other assets are classified as non-current. 
A liability is classified as current when: it is either expected to be settled in the consolidated entity's normal operating cycle; it is held primarily for the purpose of trading; it is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period, or there is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. All other liabilities are classified as non-current. For personal use only 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always classified as non-current.",rectifier
"Property, plant and equipment 
Freehold land is stated at historical cost and is not depreciated but is subject to impairment testing if there is any indication of impairment. 
Building and plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. 
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write off the net cost of each item of property, plant and equipment (excluding land) over their expected useful lives as follows: 
| Building | 50 years |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Leasehold improvement | 10 years |
| Plant and equipment | 2.5-5 years |
| Motor vehicle | 5 years | 
The residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date. 
Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful life of the assets, whichever is shorter. 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when there is no future economic benefit to the consolidated entity. Gains and losses between the carrying amount and the disposal proceeds are taken to profit or loss.",rectifier
"Right-of-use assets 
A right-of-use asset is recognised at the commencement date of a lease. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for, as applicable, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date net of any lease incentives received, any initial direct costs incurred, and, except where included in the cost of inventories, an estimate of costs expected to be incurred for dismantling and removing the underlying asset, and restoring the site or asset. For personal use only 
Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter. Where the consolidated entity expects to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the depreciation is over its estimated useful life. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment or adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. 
The consolidated entity has elected not to recognise a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability for short-term leases with terms of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. Lease payments on these assets are expensed to profit or loss as incurred.",rectifier
"Lease liabilities 
A lease liability is recognised at the commencement date of a lease. The lease liability is initially recognised at the present value of the lease payments to be made over the term of the lease, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the consolidated entity's incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments comprise of fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option when the exercise of the option is reasonably certain to occur, and any anticipated termination penalties. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. For personal use only 
Lease liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The carrying amounts are remeasured if there is a change in the following: future lease payments arising from a change in an index or a rate used; residual guarantee; lease term; the certainty of a purchase option and termination penalties. When a lease liability is remeasured, an adjustment is made to the corresponding right-of use asset, or to profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is fully written down.",rectifier
"Share-based payments 
Equity-settled share-based compensation benefits are provided to employees. 
Equity-settled transactions are awards of shares, or options over shares, that are provided to employees in exchange for the rendering of services. 
The cost of equity-settled transactions are measured at fair value on grant date. Fair value is independently determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that takes into account the exercise price, the term of the option, the impact of dilution, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield and the risk free interest rate for the term of the option, together with non-vesting conditions that do not determine whether the consolidated entity receives the services that entitle the employees to receive payment. No account is taken of any other vesting conditions. 
!",rectifier
"! 
The cost of equity-settled transactions are recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity at the vesting date which is at the grant date. The cumulative charge to profit or loss is calculated based on the grant date fair value of the award, the best estimate of the number of awards that are likely to vest and the expired portion of the vesting period. The amount recognised in profit or loss for the period is the cumulative amount calculated at each reporting date less amounts already recognised in previous periods. 
If equity-settled awards are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the modification has not been made. An additional expense is recognised, over the remaining vesting period, for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based compensation benefit as at the date of modification.",rectifier
"If the non-vesting condition is within the control of the consolidated entity or employee, the failure to satisfy the condition is treated as a cancellation. If the condition is not within the control of the consolidated entity or employee and is not satisfied during the vesting period, any remaining expense for the award is recognised over the remaining vesting period, unless the award is forfeited. 
If equity-settled awards are cancelled, it is treated as if it has vested on the date of cancellation, and any remaining expense is recognised immediately. If a new replacement award is substituted for the cancelled award, the cancelled and new award is treated as if they were a modification.",rectifier
"Identification of reportable operating segments 
The consolidated entity is organised into 4 operating segments as described below. These operating segments are based on the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the executive management committee (who are identified as the Chief Operating Decision Makers ('CODM')) in assessing performance and in determining the allocation of resources. The executive management committee considers the business from both a product and geographic perspective and assesses performance and allocates resources on this basis. There is no aggregation of operating segments.

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.
